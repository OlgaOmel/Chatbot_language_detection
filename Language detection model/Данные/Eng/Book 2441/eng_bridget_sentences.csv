An Exceptionally Bad Start
Sunday 1 January
Food consumed today:
2 pkts Emmenthal cheese slices
14 cold new potatoes
2 Bloody Marys (count as food as contain Worcester sauce and tomatoes)
1/3 Ciabatta loaf with Brie
Coriander leaves 1/2 packet
12 Milk Tray (best to get rid of all Christmas confectionery in one go and make fresh start tomorrow)
13 cocktail sticks securing cheese and pineapple
My mother rang up at 8.30 in the morning last August Bank Holiday and forced me to promise to go.
She approached it via a cunningly circuitous route.
Just a little compact case with a pull-out handle.
"Exhausted, I held the phone away from my ear, puzzling about where the missionary luggage-Christmas-gift zeal had stemmed from."
"in actual fact, you can get them with a compartment with bottles for your bubble bath and things."
"I said desperately, blinking in the dazzling Bank Holiday sunlight."
You can drive up after work.
"Oh, did I mention?"
Malcolm and Elaine Darcy are coming and bringing Mark with them.
"Do you remember Mark, darling?"
Not another strangely dressed opera freak with bushy hair burgeoning from a side-parting.
Una and Geoffrey have been holding the New Year Buffet since you were running round the lawn with no clothes on!
First day of New Year has been day of horror.
It is too humiliating at my age.
"Having skulked at home all day, hoping hangover would clear, I eventually gave up and set off for the Turkey Curry Buffet far too late."
I was also suffering from road-rage residue after inadvertently getting on to the M6 instead of the M1 and having to drive halfway to Birmingham before I could find anywhere to turn round.
"I was so furious I kept jamming my foot down to the floor on the accelerator pedal to give vent to my feelings, which is very dangerous."
"She seemed to manage to kiss me, get my coat off, hang it over the banister, wipe her lipstick off my cheek and make me feel incredibly guilty all in one movement, while I leaned against the ornament shelf for support."
What are we going to do with you?
"said Geoffrey Alconbury, clad in a yellow diamond-patterned sweater."
He did a jokey Bruce Forsyth step then gave me the sort of hug which Boots would send straight to the police station.
"Una, she came off at Junction nineteen!"
"roared Brian Enderby (married to Mavis, used to be president of the Rotary in Kettering), waving his sherry in the air."
Fortunately my dad rescued me.
Come and demonstrate your presence so I can start enjoying myself.
"It was all right, I suppose."
Apparently he had the most terrible time with his wife.
"Being set up with a man against your will is one level of humiliation, but being literally dragged into it by Una Alconbury while caring for an acidic hangover, watched by an entire roomful of friends of your parents, is on another plane altogether."
It struck me as pretty ridiculous to be called Mr Darcy and to stand on your own looking snooty at a party.
I racked my brain frantically to think when I last read a proper book.
The trouble with working in publishing is that reading in your spare time is a bit like being a dustman and snuffling through the pig bin in the evening.
Then I had a brainwave.
"Anyway, completely safe option as no way diamond-pattern-jumpered goody-goody would have read five-hundred-page feminist treatise."
"I said wildly, racking my brains for a way to get off the subject."
I was at a party in London last night.
I could feel it climbing up my neck.
As I looked down I saw that he was wearing white socks with a yellow bumblebee motif
"I said, to show I had had a genuine reason for coming over, which was quite definitely gherkin-based rather than phone-number-related."
He blinked at me.
"2 a.m. Oh, why am I so unattractive?"
Even a man who wears bumblebee socks thinks I am horrible.
Hate the New Year.
Am going to consume them and have fag.
Tuesday 3 January
9st 4 (terrifying slide into obesity â€“ why?
Cannot face thought of go to work.
"Only thing which makes it tolerable is thought of seeing Daniel again, but even that is inadvisable since am fat, have spot on chin, and desire only to sit on cushion eating chocolate and watching Xmas specials."
"Was really beginning to enjoy the feeling that normal service was suspended and it was OK to lie in bed as long as you want, put anything you fancy into your mouth, and drink alcohol whenever it should chance to pass your way, even in the mornings."
Now suddenly we are all supposed to snap into self-discipline like lean teenage greyhounds.
"I looked at her wistfully, her vast, bulbous bottom swathed in a tight red skirt with a bizarre three-quarter-length striped waistcoat strapped across it."
What a blessing to be born with such Sloaney arrogance.
Perpetua could be the size of a Renault Espace and not give it a thought.
"How many hours, months, years, have I spent worrying about weight while Perpetua has been happily looking for lamps with porcelain cats as bases around the Fulham Road?"
"She is missing out on a source of happiness, anyway."
"It is proved by surveys that happiness does not come from love, wealth or power but the pursuit of attainable goals: and what is a diet if not that?"
"On way home in end-of-Christmas denial I bought a packet of cut-price chocolate tree decorations and a ?3.69 bottle of sparkling wine from Norway, Pakistan or similar."
"I guzzled them by the light of the Christmas tree, together with a couple of mince pies, the last of the Christmas cake and some Stilton, while watching EastEnders, imagining it was a Christmas special."
"Now, though, I feel ashamed and repulsive."
I can actually feel the fat splurging out from my body.
"Sometimes you have to sink to a nadir of toxic fat envelopment in order to emerge, phoenix-like, from the chemical wasteland as a purged and beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer figure."
Tomorrow new Spartan health and beauty regime will begin.
"Love his wicked dissolute air, while being v. successful and clever."
"He was being v. funny today, telling everyone about his aunt thinking the onyx kitchen-roll holder his mother had given her for Christmas was a model of a penis."
Was really v. amusing about it.
Also asked me if I got anything nice for Christmas in rather flirty way.
Think might wear short black skirt tomorrow.
Wednesday 4 January
"9st 5 (stateof emergency now as if fat hasbeen stored incapsule form over Christmasand is being slowly releasedunder skin),alcoholunits 5 (better), cigarettes 20, calories700 (v.g.)"
"Her boyfriend, Vile Richard (self-indulgent commitment phobic), whom she has been seeing on and off for eighteen months, had chucked her for asking him if he wanted to come on holiday with her."
"Typical, but Jude naturally was blaming it all on herself."
I asked for too much to satisfy my own neediness rather than need.
I immediately called Sharon and an emergency summit has been scheduled for 6.30 in Cafe Rouge.
I hope I can get away without bloody Perpetua kicking up.
"As women glide from their twenties to thirties, Shazzer argues, the balance of power subtly shifts."
"Even the most outrageous minxes lose their nerve, wrestling with the first twinges of existential angst: fears of dying alone and being found three weeks later half-eaten by an Alsatian."
"Stereotypical notions of shelves, spinning wheels and sexual scrapheaps cons ire to make you feel stupid, no matter how much time you spend thinking about Joanna Lumley and Susan Sarandon."
"After all, there is nothing so unattractive to a man as strident feminism."
"Thinking moonily about Daniel Cleaver, I ventured that not all men are like Richard."
"At which point Sharon started on a long illustrative list of emotional fuckwittage in progress amongst our friends: one whose boyfriend of thirteen years refuses even to discuss living together; another who went out with a man four times who then chucked her because it was getting too serious; another who was pursued by a bloke for three months with impassioned proposals of marriage, only to find him ducking out three weeks after she succumbed and repeating the whole process with her best friend."
He ambled over to us to say hi.
"I ought to stop it really, but, well ."
"Jude and I forcibly restrained her while Alex, looking panic-stricken, rushed back, to continue his fuckwittage unrumbled."
Eventually the three of us worked out a strategy for Jude.
After Jude had gone because she has to get up at 5.45 to go to the gym and see her personal shopper before work starts at 8.30 (mad) â€“ Sharon and I were suddenly filled with remorse and self-loathing for not advising Jude simply to get rid of Vile Richard because he is vile.
Thursday 5 January
"9st 3(excellent progress â€“ 21b of fat spontaneously combustedthrough joy and sexual promise), alcohol units 6 (v.g."
"forparty), cigarettes 12 (continuing good work), calories 1258(love has eradicated need to pig out)."
Daniel Cleaver just sent me a message.
Was trying to work on CV without Perpetua noticing (in preparation for improving career) when Message Pending suddenly flashed up on top of screen.
"Delighted by, well, anything â€“ as always am if is not work â€“ I quickly pressed RMS Execute and nearly jumped out of my skin when I saw Cleave at the bottom of the message."
I instantly thought he had been able to tap into the computer and see that I was not getting on with my work.
But then I read the message:
You appear to have forgotten your skirt.
I think is made perfectly clear in your
"contract of employment, staff are expected"
to be fully dressed at all times.
"Thought for a little while whilst pretending to study tedious-beyond-belief manuscript from lunatic Have never messaged Daniel Cleaver before but brilliant thing about messaging system is you can be really quite cheeky and informal, even to your boss."
Also can spend ages practising.
This is what sent.
"Sir, am appalled by message."
could reasonably be described as a little
on the skimpy side (thrift being ever our
"watchword in editorial), consider it gross"
misrepresentation to describe said skirt as
"absent, and considering contacting union."
Waited in frenzy of excitement for reply.
Sure enough Message Pending quickly flashed up.
Will whoever has thoughtlessly removed the
desk PLEASE have the decency to return it
Daniel has not replied.
Maybe he was being serious about the skirt.
Oh God oh God.
Have been seduced by informality of messaging medium into being impertinent to boss.
Maybe he has not got it yet.
If one could get message back.
He is in meeting with Simon from Marketing.
He gave me a look when walked past.
If walking past office was attempt to
demonstrate presence of skirt can only say
that it has failed parlously.
Is skirt off sick?
Message Pending then flashed up again immediately.
"If skirt is indeed sick, please look into how"
many days sick leave skirt has taken in previous
Spasmodic nature of recent
skirt attendance suggests malingering
Just sending back:
Skirt is demonstrably neither sick nor
blatently sizist attitude to skirt.
Obsessive interest in skirt suggests
management sick rather than skirt.
Think will cross last bit out as contains mild accusation of sexual harassment whereas v. much enjoying being sexually harassed by Daniel Cleaver.
Perpetua just walked past and started reading over shoulder.
Just managed to press Alt Screen in nick of time but big mistake as merely put CV back up on screen.
"said Perpetua, with a nasty smirk."
â€“ I got back to work.
This is what I am about to send.
Skirt is demonstrably neither sick nor
blatently sizist attitude to skirt.
"Considering appeal to industrial tribunal,"
This was return message.
"Absent, Jones, not abscent."
Please attempt to acquire at
least perfunctory grasp of spelling.
by no means trying to suggest language fixed
"rather than constantly adapting, fluctuating"
tool of communication (cf Hoenigswald)
computer spell check might help.
Was just feeling crestfallen when Daniel walked past with Simon from Marketing and shot a very sexy look at my skirt with one eyebrow raised.
Love the lovely computer messaging.
"Must work on spelling, though."
"After all, have degree in English."
Friday 6 January
5.45 p.m. Could not be more joyous.
Computer messaging re: presence or otherwise of skirt continued obsessively all afternoon.
Cannot imagine respected boss did stroke of work.
"Weird scenario with Perpetua (penultimate boss), since knew I was messaging and v. angry, but fact that was messaging ultimate boss gave self conflicting feelings of loyalty â€“ distinctly un-level playing field where anyone with ounce of sense would say ultimate boss should hold sway."
Last message read:
Wish to send bouquet to ailing skirt over
Please supply home contact no asap
"as cannot, for obvious reasons, rely on"
Am irresistible Sex Goddess.
Sunday 8 January
9st 2(v.bloody g. but what is point?
"2 p.m. Oh God, why am I so unattractive?"
Cannot believe I convinced myself I was keeping the entire weekend free to work when in fact I was on permanent date-with-Daniel standby.
"Hideous, wasted two days glaring psychopathically at the phone, and eating things."
Must centre myself more.
"Will ask Jude about appropriate self-help book, possible Eastern-religion-based."
"Phone call alert, which turned out to be just Tom, asking if there was any telephonic progress."
"Tom, who has taken, unflatteringly, to calling himself a hag-fag, has been sweetly supportive about the Daniel crisis."
Tom has a theory that homosexuals and single women in their thirties have natural bonding: both being accustomed to disappointing their parents and being treated as freaks by society.
What about my human right not to have to wander round with fearsome unattractiveness hang-up?
It is far too late for Daniel to ring.
V. sad and traumatized.
Monday 9 January
"9st 2,alcohol units 4,cigarettes29, calories 770 (v.g.but at what price?)."
Nightmare day in office.
Watched the door for Daniel all morning: nothing.
I was seriously alarmed.
Should I raise an alert?
"Panic stricken, I reached for the Silk Cut."
"The second I put the phone down I realized it was an emergency and rang Tom, who calmly said leave it to him: if he made several calls to the machine he could find the code which would let him play back and erase the message."
Tuesday 10 January
"9st 1, alcohol units 2, cigarettes 6, calories 998 (excellent, v.g."
Slunk into the office crippled with embarrassment about the message.
I had resolved totally to detach myself from Daniel but then he appeared looking unnervingly sexy and started making everyone laugh so that I went all to pieces.
"Suddenly, Message Pending flashed up on the top of my computer screen."
Thanks for your phone call.
That phone call was suggesting a date.
Please shut up.
I am very busy and
"And after a few minutes more, he replied."
"Sorry to interrupt, Jones, pressure must be hellish."
I like your tits in that top.
And we were off.
"Frantic messaging continued all week, culminating in him suggesting a date for Sunday night and me dizzyingly, euphorically, accepting."
Sometimes I look around the office as we all tap away and wonder if anyone is doing any work at all.
"All wrong, like Saturday morning or Monday at 2 p.m.)"
Sunday 15 January
"9st (excellent), alcohol units 0, cigarettes 29 (v.v."
"in 2 hours), caloriess 3879 (repulsive), negative thoughts 942(approx."
"per minute), minutes spent counting negative thoughts 127 (approx.)."
Completely exhausted by entire day of date-preparation.
"Being a woman is worse than being a farmer there is so much harvesting and crop spraying to be done: legs to be waxed, underarms shaved, eyebrows plucked, feet pumiced, skin exfoliated and moisturized, spots cleansed, roots dyed, eyelashes tinted, nails filed, cellulite massaged, stomach muscles exercised."
The whole performance is so highly tuned you only need to neglect it for a few days for the whole thing to go to seed.
"Sometimes I wonder what I would be like if left to revert to nature â€“ with a full beard and handlebar moustache on each shin, Dennis Healey eyebrows, face a graveyard of dead skin cells, spots erupting, long curly fingernails like Struwelpeter, blind as bat and stupid runt of species as no contact lenses, flabby body flobbering around."
Is it any wonder girls have no confidence?
Cannot believe this has happened.
"On the way to the bathroom, to complete final farming touches, I noticed the answerphone light was flashing: Daniel."
Cannot believe it.
"Still, he is in top-level job."
"He might have bloody well rung again, though."
Is probably out with someone thinner.
5 a.m. What s wrong with me?
Am going to have nothing more to do with him.
Am going to get weighed.
Monday 16 January
9 st 2(fromwhere?
Daniel is still locked in his meeting.
Maybe it was a genuine excuse.
1 p.m. Just saw Daniel leaving for lunch.
He has not messaged me or anything.
"Tom said not to be paranoid, give it time, but I could tell he was not concentrating and only wanted to talk about Jerome as suffused with sex-lust."
Tuesday 24 January
Friday 27 January
"9st 3(but stuffed with Genoan food),alcohol units 8,cigarettes 400 (feels like), calories 875."
"Then he lightly brushed a hair from my forehead, took my cheek in his hand and kissed me, urgently, desperately."
"The second we were inside his flat we upon each other like beasts: shoes, jackets, strewn in a trail across the room."
"Then, caveat in place, he carried on with the zip."
"As it was, I leapt to my feet, pulling up my skirt."
I am not interested in emotional fuckwittage.
You should have seen his face.
But no I am home I am sunk into gloom.
"I may have been right, but my reward, I know, will be to end up all alone, half-eaten by an Alsatian."
Wednesday 1 February
"9 st, alcohol units 9, cigarettes 28 (but will soon give up for Lent so might as well smoke self into disgusted smoking frenzy), calories 3826."
Spent the weekend struggling to remain disdainfully buoyant after the Daniel fuckwittage debacle.
Smoking was v. bad.
Mum had been to church and suddenly realized in a St Paul-on-road-to-Damascus-type blinding flash that the vicar is gay.
Look at your Tom.
"My dad, somewhat bizarrely, insisted on giving my car a full service before I left, even though I assured him there was nothing wrong with it."
I rather showed myself up by not remembering how to open the bonnet.
"he said in a stiff, embarrassed way as he fiddled around with the oil stick, wiping it with rags and plunging it back in a not unworrying manner, if one were a Freudian."
Which I am not.
"They were a little on the frou-frou side, to tell the truth."
Dressed from head to toe in rose pink.
I racked my brains.
Best get off before it gets dark.
Send my love to Jude.
Then he hit the bonnet in an off-you-go sort of way but so hard that I had a feeling he might have broken his hand.
"Worried about own ambition, career prospects and moral seriousness as seem to reduce everything to level of scout disco."
Eventually managed to worm out of Perpetua that Daniel has gone to New York.
"He will clearly by now have got off with thin American cool person called Winona who puts out, carries a gun and is everything I am not."
"Such occasions always reduce my ego to size of snail, which is not to say am not grateful to be asked."
I love Magda and Jeremy.
"Sometimes I stay at their house, admiring the crisp sheets and many storage jars full of different kinds of pasta, imagining that they are my parents."
But when they are together with their married friends I feel as if I have turned into Miss Havisham.
11.45 p.m. Oh God.
Why do they do this?
Maybe they really do want to patronize us and make us feel like failed human beings.
I slurred with a pointless attempt at sarcasm.
"All eyes turned to me, beadily."
and they all leapt to their feet and started getting ready to go home.
"whispered Magda, who knew how I was feeling."
"I trilled, hurrying out into the street."
Then I got into a taxi and burst into tears.
Sunday 5 February
Still no word from Daniel.
Cannot face thought of entire Sunday stretching ahead with everyone else in the world except me in bed with someone giggling and having sex.
No way will I get any cards.
"Toy with idea of flirting energetically with anyone I think might be induced to send me one, but dismiss as immoral."
Will just have to take total indignity on the chin.
Then will feel like caring angel or saint.
The last remaining tiny bathmat of security has been pulled from under my feet.
Magnanimous offer to pay caring surprise visit met by odd-sounding Dad on end of phone.
I tried to get Dad to explain but got nowhere.
What is going on?
Is the whole world doomed to emotional trauma?
"Am I to be the tragic victim of a broken home now, on top of everything else?"
Monday 6 February
"8st 12 (heavy internal weight completely vanished â€“ mystery),alcohol units I (v.g."
Daniel will be back in the office today.
"I shall be poised and cool and remember that I am a woman of substance and do not need men in order to be complete, especially not him, Am not going to message him or indeed take any notice of him whatsoever."
Daniel does not seem to be here yet.
Still no sign of Daniel.
"9.36 a.m. Oh God, oh God."
9.47 a.m. Or gone to Las Vegas and got married.
think will go inspect make-up in case he does come in.
10.05 a.m. Heart gave great lurch when got back from loos and saw Daniel standing with Simon from Marketing at the photocopier.
The last time I saw him he was lying on his sofa looking completely nonplussed while I fastened my skirt and ranted about fuckwittage.
As I passed he looked pointedly at my skirt and gave me a huge grin.
Message Pending flashed up on screen.
Pressed RMS to pick up message.
When I looked across to his little glass office he was smiling at me in a relieved and fond sort of way.
"Anyway, am not going to message him back."
"Seems rude not to reply, though."
11.00 a.m. Tee hee.
Just logged on as Perpetua to give Daniel a fright.
"It is hard enough as it is, trying to meet"
your targets without people wasting my
well and have sent it home.
10 p.m. Daniel and I messaged each other all day.
But there is no way I am going to sleep with him.
Rang Mum and Dad again tonight but no one answered.
Thursday 9 February
"9st 2 (extra fat presumably caused by winter whale blubber), alcohol units 4, cigarettes 12 (v.g."
"9 p.m. V. much enjoying the Winter Wonderland and reminder that we are at the mercy of the elements, and should not concentrate so hard on being sophisticated or hardworking but on staying warm and watching the telly."
This is the third time I have called Mum and Dad this week and got no reply.
Maybe The Gables has been cut off by the snow?
"9.15 p.m. Just called Mum and Dad three times in a row, letting it ring twenty times each time."
Saturday 11 February
"8st 13,alcohol units 4, cigarettes 18,calories1467(but burntoff by shopping)"
Just got home from shopping to message from my dad asking if I would meet him for lunch on Sunday.
I went hot and cold.
My dad does not come up to London to have lunch with me on his own on Sundays.
"He has roast beef, or salmon and new potatoes, at home with Mum."
"I went round the corner, shaking, for some Silk Cut."
Got back to find message from Mum.
"She too is coming to see me for lunch tomorrow, apparently."
Sunday 12 February
"8st13,alcoholunits5,cigarettes 23 (hardlysurprising),calories 1647."
It is too Brian Rix for words.
"Maybe the whole lunch thing is just a parental practical joke brought on by over-exposure of my parents to Noel Edmonds, popular television and similar."
Perhaps my mother will arrive with a live salmon flipping skittishly on a lead and announce that she is leaving Dad for it.
The only thing which can possibly get everything back on course is a Bloody Mary.
12.05 p.m. Mum called.
"I said, as if this were Sleepless in Seattle and lunch was going to end up with Mum and Dad holding hands and me winking cutely at the camera, wearing a luminous rucksack."
"As he sat down on the sofa, his face crumpled and tears began to splosh down his cheeks."
This is all my fault.
"If I were a better person, Mum would not have stopped loving Dad.)"
He collapsed in quiet sobs.
Monday 13 February
"9st 1, alcohol units 5, cigarettes 0 (spiritual enrichment removes need to smoke â€“ massive breakthrough), calories 2845."
It is so long since I have done anything at all for anyone else that it is a totally new and heady sensation.
This is what has been missing in my life.
"I am having fantasies about becoming a Samaritan or Sunday school teacher, making soup for the homeless (or, as my friend Tom suggested, darling mini-bruschettas with pesto sauce), or even retraining as a doctor."
"Maybe going out with a doctor would be better still, both sexually and spiritually fulfilling."
I even began to wonder about putting an ad in the lonely hearts column of the Lancet.
"I could take his messages, tell patients wanting night visits to bugger off, cook him little goat cheese souffles, then end up in a foul mood with him when I am sixty, like Mum."
Why is entire world geared to make people not involved in romance feel stupid when everyone knows romance does not work anyway.
Look at royal family.
Look at Mum and Dad.
Matter of supreme indifference to me.
Tuesday 14 February
"8 a.m. Oooh, goody."
Wonder if the post has come yet.
Maybe there will be a card from Daniel.
Or a secret admirer.
Or some flowers or heart-shaped chocolates.
Brief moment of wild joy when discovered bunch of roses in the hallway.
Rushed down and gleefully picked them up just as the downstairs-flat door opened and Vanessa came out.
"I said coyly, glancing down at the card."
It was an Access bill.
Decided to have cappuccino and chocolate croissants on way to work to cheer self up.
Do not care about figure.
Is no point as no one loves or cares about me.
Got into the office to find Perpetua had a bunch of flowers the size of a sheep on her desk.
she bellowed so that everyone could hear.
I thought she was going to get hold of my earlobe and start twisting it or something.
It was only then that I noticed Daniel was listening to us across the room and laughing.
Wednesday 15 February
"For a moment I was excited, imagining it was for me and suddenly seeing myself as a dark, mysterious object of desire to men out in the street."
Then I remembered bloody Vanessa and her slinky dark bob.
9 p.m. Just got back and card is still there.
The card is still there.
Thursday 16 February
"8st12(weight lossthrough use of stairs), alcohol units 0(excellent), cigarettes5 (excellent), calories2452 (not vg."
The card is still there!
Obviously it is like eating the last Milk Tray or taking the last slice of cake.
We are both too polite to take it.
Friday 17 February
"8st 12,alcohol units1 (v.g."
9 a.m. Card is still there.
Could stand it no longer.
"Could tell Vanessa was in as cooking smells emanating from flat, so knocked on door."
"I handed it to her, she gave it back to me, giggling."
I gave it back to her.
It was rather an arty card as if it might have been bought in an art gallery.
She pulled a face.
I let out a high-pitched noise.
10 p.m. Just called Sharon and recounted whole thing to her.
She said I should not allow my head to be turned by a cheap card and should lay off Daniel as he is not a very nice person and no good will come of it.
"Called Tom for second opinion, particularly on whether I should call Daniel over the weekend."
I reported that he had seemed flirtier than usual.
Saturday 18 February
"9st, alcohol units 4, cigarettes 6, calories 2746, correct lottery numbers 2 (v,g.)."
At last I got to the bottom of Mum and Dad.
Today she asked me to meet her for lunch at the coffee place in Dickens and Jones and I asked her outright if she was seeing someone else.
"There is no one else, she said, staring into the distance with a look of melancholy bravery I swear she has copied from Princess Diana."
You only get one life.
"Sure enough, I eventually found her in the perfume department wandering round with the tall smoothie, spraying her wrists with everything in sight, holding them up to his face and laughing coquettishly."
Got home to answerphone message from my brother Jamie.
Called him straight away and told him everything.
"Get any Valentines this year, did you?"
"At which he burst out laughing again, then said he had to go because he and Becca were off to do Tai Chi in the park."
Sunday 19 February
8st 13 (v.g.
Called Mum up to confront her about the late-in-life smoothie I saw her with after our lunch.
This was an immediate giveaway.
My parents do not describe their friends by their Christian names.
"I sensed also that she had met him in Portugal, before the trouble with Dad, and he might well turn out to be not so much Julian but Julio."
I confronted her with this hunch.
"However, there were no work videos to take round and watch, so he had to construct a further cobweb of lies."
"The incident culminated with the girl, convinced he was having an affair with someone else when it was only their second date, chucking him, and Simon spending the evening getting hammered alone with his spot, wearing his seventies jacket."
Tuesday 21 February
"Dad has taken to ringing up several times in the night, just to talk."
Wednesday 22 Februar y
"9st, alcohol units 2, cigarettes 9, fat units 8 (unexpectedly repulsive notion: never before faced reality of lard splurging from bottom and thighs under skin."
Must revert to calorie counting tomorrow).
Tom was completely right.
"I made a complete arse of myself today, though."
"I got in the lift to go out for a sandwich and found Daniel in there with Simon from Marketing, talking about footballers being arrested for throwing matches."
Simon looked at me as if I was mad and Daniel stared for a moment and then burst out laughing.
Thursday 23 February
8st 13 (If only could stay under 9st.
"and not keep bobbing up and down like drowning corpse â€“ drowning in fat), alcohol units 2, cigarettes 17 (pre-shag nerves â€“ understandable), calories 775 (last-ditch attempt to get down to 8st 7 before tomorrow)."
Computer messaging somehow whipped itself up to fever pitch.
"There we were, just him and me, caught in a massive electrical-charge field, pulled together irresistibly, like a pair of magnets."
"Then suddenly the lift stopped and we broke apart, panting, as Simon from Marketing got in wearing a hideous beige raincoat over his fat frame."
As I left the building Daniel popped out after me and asked me to have dinner with him tomorrow.
Surely it is not normal to be revising for a date as if it were a job interview?
"Maybe I should have fallen for someone younger and mindless who would cook for me, wash all my clothes and agree with everything I say."
"Since leaving work I have nearly slipped a disc, wheezing through a step aerobics class, scratched my naked body for seven minutes with a stiff brush; cleaned the flat; filled the fudge, plucked my eyebrows, skimmed the papers and the Ultimate Sex Guide, put the washing in and waxed my own legs, since it was too late to book an appointment."
Ended up kneeling on a towel trying to pull off a wax strip firmly stuck to the back of my calf while watching Newsnight in an effort to drum up some interesting opinions about things.
"My back hurts, my head aches and my legs are bright red and covered in lumps of wax."
"Wise people will say Daniel should like me just as I am, but I am a child of Cosmopolitan culture, have been traumatized by super-models and too many quizzes and know that neither my personality nor my body is up to it if left to its own devices."
I am going to cancel and spend the evening eating doughnuts in a cardigan with egg on it.
Saturday 25 February
"8st 10 (miracle: sex proved indeed to be best form of exercise),alcohol units 0, cigarettes 0, calories 200 (at last have foundthe secret of not eating: simply replace food with sex)."
6 p.m. Oh joy.
"Have spent the day in a state I can only describe as shag-drunkenness, mooning about the flat, smiling, picking things up and putting them down again."
It was so lovely.
"But as the rosy clouds begin to disperse, I begin to feel alarm."
No plans were made.
Suddenly I realize I am waiting for the phone again.
How can it be that the situation between the sexes after a first night remains so agonizingly imbalanced?
Feel as if I have just sat an exam and must wait for my results.
11 p.m. Oh God.
"Are we going out now, or what?"
Maybe their generation is just better at getting on with relationships?
Sunday 26 February
"9st, alcohol units 5 (drowning sorrows), cigarettes 23 (fumigating sorrows), calories 3856 (smothering sorrows in fat-duvet)."
"Awake, alone, to find myself imagining my mother in bed with Julio Consumed with repulsion at vision of parental, or rather demi-parental sex; outrage on behalf of father; heady, selfish optimism at example of another thirty years of unbridled passion ahead of me (not unrelated to frequent thoughts of Goldie Hawn and Susan Sarandon); but mainly extreme sense of jealousy of failure and foolishness at being in bed alone on Sunday morning while my mother aged over sixty is probably just about to do it for the second ."
Saturday 4 March
9st (what is point of dieting for whole of Feb when end up exactly same weight at start of March as start of Feb?
Am going to stop getting weighed and counting things every day as no sodding point).
My mother has become a force I no longer recognize.
"She burst into my flat this morning as I sat slumped in my dressing gown, sulkily painting my toenails and watching the preamble to the racing."
"she trilled, flinging an armful of carrier bags down and heading for my bedroom."
"Minutes later, in a fit of mild curiosity, I slobbed after her to see what she was doing."
"She was sitting in front of the mirror in an expensive-looking coffee-colored bra-slip, mascara-ing her eyelashes with her mouth wide open (necessity of open mouth during mascara application great unexplained mystery of nature)."
"She looked stunning: skin clear, hair shining."
I caught sight of myself in the mirror.
I really should have taken my makeup off last night.
"One side of my hair was plastered to my head, the other sticking out in a series of peaks and horns."
The man was really quite overbearing with me.
"He took the point, talked me through it and we had it done inside fifteen minutes."
"I stammered, grabbing at the door frame."
She has power over Dad: he wants her back.
"She has power over Julio, and the tax man, and everyone is sensing her power and wanting a bit of it, which makes her even more irresistible."
I am so depressed.
"Daniel, though perfectly chatty, friendly, even flirty all week, has given me no hint as to what is going on between us, as though it is perfectly normal to sleep with one of your colleagues and just leave it at that."
Work â€“ once merely an annoying nuisance â€“ has become an agonizing torture.
I have major trauma every time he disappears for lunch or puts his coat on to go at end of day: to where?
"No, I quite agree."
At 4:15 on Friday evening Sharon rang me in the office.
"I silently panicked, thinking, Surely Daniel will ask to see me this weekend before he leaves the office?"
At 5:45 saw Daniel with his coat on heading out of the door.
"My traumatized expression must have shamed even him because he smiled shiftily, nodded at the computer screen and shot out."
"Sure enough, Message Pending was flashing."
Have a good weekend.
"Miserably, I picked up the phone and dialed Sharon."
Tell him to bugger off from me.
2 a.m. Argor sworeal brilleve with Shazzan Jude.
Dun stupid care about Daniel stupid prat.
Sunday 5 March
8 a.m. Ugh.
"Am never, ever going to drink again for the rest of life."
Could really fancy some chips.
Badly need water but seems better to keep eyes closed and head stationary on pillow so as not to disturb bits of machinery and pheasants in head.
Bloody good fun but v. confused re: advice re: Daniel.
"I waited humbly, therefore, till it was my turn to recount the latest Daniel instalment."
"Daniel, argued Jude, was bound to be anxious about work situation, etc., etc., so give him a chance, be friendly and flirty: so as to reassure him that you trust him and are not going to become needy or fly off the handle."
At this Sharon practically spat into the shaved Parmesan and said it was inhuman to leave a woman hanging in air for two weekends after sex and an appalling breach of confidence and I should tell him what I think of him.
Going to have another little sleep.
2 p.m. Just triumphantly returned from heroic expedition to go downstairs for newspaper and glass of water.
Could feel water flowing like crystal stream into section of head where most required.
"Though am not sure, come to think of it, if water can actually get in your head."
Possibly it enters through the bloodstream.
Maybe since hangovers are caused by dehydration water is drawn into the brain by a form of capillary action.
2.15 p.m. Story in papers about two-year-olds having to take tests to get into nursery school just made me jump out of skin.
"Heart was sinking at thought of being late and hungover, surrounded by ex-career-girl mothers and their Competitive Child Rearing."
"Even the conception was cut-throat, with Magda trying to take eight times as much folic acid and minerals as anyone else."
The birth was great.
"Tea party was nightmare scenario: me plus a roomful of power mothers, one of whom had a four-week-old baby."
"Magda embarrassed herself two years ago by boasting at a dinner party that Harry got ten in his, at which one of the other guests, who happens to be a nurse, pointed out that the AGPAR test only goes up to nine."
"Undaunted, however, Magda has started boasting around the nanny circuit that her son is a defecational prodigy, triggering off a round of boast and counter-boast."
Thought head was going to burst with the racket.
"Eventually made my excuses and drove home, congratulating myself on being single."
Monday 6 March
11 a.m. Office.
Last night was just lying in nice hot bath with some Geranium essential oil and a vodka and tonic when the doorbell rang.
"It was my mother, on the doorstep in floods of tears."
And some horrible mean part of me felt happy and smug because I had a career.
"Well â€“ a job, anyway."
"Eventually I managed to cheer Mum up by allowing her to go through my wardrobe and criticize all my clothes, then tell me why I should start getting everything from Jaeger and Country Casuals."
"Tom said I should listen to neither of them, not flirt, not lecture but merely be an aloof, coolly professional ice-queen."
"Men, he claims, view themselves as permanently on some sort of sexual ladder with all women either above them or below them."
This whole mentality depresses me enormously but Tom said not to be naive and if I really love Daniel and want to win his heart I have to ignore him and be as cold and distant to him as possible.
"Eventually got to bed at midnight, v. confused, but was woken three times in the night by phone calls from Dad."
and he burst into tears.
"I suddenly realize everything has shifted and now I am looking after my parents instead of them looking after me, which seems unnatural and wrong."
Surely I am not that old?
Monday 6 March
8st 12 (v.v.g.
â€“ have realized secret of dieting is not weighing oneself).
"Can officially confirm that the way to a man s heart these days is not through beauty, food, sex, or alluringness of character, but merely the ability to seem not very interested in him."
Took no notice of Daniel whatsoever all day at work and pretended to be busy (try not to laugh).
"Message Pending kept flashing but I just kept sighing and tossing my hair about as if I were a very glamorous, important person under a great deal of pressure."
"By the end of the day I realized, like a school chemistry lab miracle (phosphorus, litmus test or similar), it was working."
He kept staring at me and giving me meaningful glances.
"and swept him away, which was fortunate because the phone call was Tom, who said I had to keep up the ice-queen act and gave me a mantra to repeat when I felt myself weakening."
"9st 4, 2 or 5??"
"alcohol units 0, cigarettes 20, calories 1500, Instants 6 (poor)."
How can I have put on 3lb since the middle of the night?
"I was 9st 4 when I went to bed, 9st 2 at 4 a.m. and 9st 5 when I got up."
I can understand weight coming off â€“ it could have evaporated or passed out of the body into the toilet â€“ but how could it be put on?
"Could food react chemically with other food, double its density and volume, and solidify into every heavier and denser hard fat?"
So maybe my whole body is getting smaller but denser.
The whole thing smacks of female body-builders and makes me feel strangely sick.
Breakfast: hot-cross bun (Scarsdale Diet â€“ slight variation on specified piece of wholemeal toast); Mars Bar (Scarsdale Diet â€“ slight variation on specified half grapefruit)
"Snack: two bananas, two pears (switched to F-plan as starving and cannot face Scarsdale carrot snacks)."
Carton orange juice (Anti-Cellulite Raw-Food Diet)
"Lunch: jacket potato (Scarsdale Vegetarian Diet) and hummus (Hay Diet â€“ fine with jacket spuds as all starch, and breakfast and snack were all alkaline-forming with exception of hot-cross bun and Mars: minor aberration)"
"Dinner: four glasses of wine, fish and chips (Scarsdale Diet and also Hay Diet â€“ protein forming); portion tiramisu; peppermint Aero (pissed)"
Tuesday 14 March
Next thing he came up and asked if I wanted to come round the corner for lunch.
"I stood stock still on the pavement, glowering up at him."
"he said, looking amused."
"It was very bad to carry on flirting, sleep with me then not even follow it up with a phone call, and try to pretend the whole thing never happened."
"Either go out with me and treat me nicely, or leave me alone."
We stared at each other transfixed like two African animals at the start of a fight on a David Attenborough programme.
"Then suddenly Daniel turned on his heel and walked off to the pub, leaving me to stagger, stunned, back to the office, where I dived to the loo, locked the door and sat down, staring crazily at the door with one eye."
5 p.m. Har har.
Feeling v. pleased with self.
"Had top-level post-works crisis meeting in Cafe Rouge with Sharon, Jude and Tom, who were all delighted with, the Daniel outcome, each convinced it was because I had followed their advice."
"Also Jude had heard survey on the radio that by the turn of the millennium a third of all households will be single, therefore proving that at last we are no longer tragic freaks."
Sharon maintains men â€“ present company (i.e.
"Tom) excepted, obviously â€“ are so catastrophically unevolved that soon they will just be kept by women as pets for sex, therefore presumably these will not count as shared households as the men will be kept outside in kennels."
"Anyway, feeling v. empowered."
"5 a.m. Oh God, am so unhappy about Daniel."
Wednesday 15 March
"9st, alcohol units 5 (disgrace: urine of Satan), cigarettes 14 (weed of Satan â€“ will give up on birthday), calories 1795."
Have woken up v. fed up.
"On top of everything, only two weeks to go until birthday, when will have to face up to the fact that another entire year has gone by, during which everyone else except me has mutated into Smug Married, having children plop, plop, plop, left right and centre and making hundreds of thousands of pounds and inroads into very hub of establishment, while I career rudderless and, boyfriendless through dysfunctional relationships and professional stagnation."
Try to concentrate hard on Joanna Lumley and Susan Sarandon.
Also worried about how to celebrate birthday.
Size of flat and bank balance prohibits actual party.
But then would have to spend birthday slaving and would hate all guests on arrival.
"Could all go out for meal but then feel guilty asking everyone to pay, selfishly presuming to force costly and dull evening on others merely to celebrate own birthday â€“ yet cannot afford to pay for everyone."
"Wish had not been born but immaculately burst into being in similar, though not identical, manner to Jesus, then would not have had to have birthday."
"Sympathize with Jesus in sense of embarrassment he must, and perhaps should, feel over two-millennium-old social imposition of own birthday on large areas of globe."
"Am going to ask everyone round for cocktails, perhaps Manhattans."
"Will then have given to guests something in manner of grand society hostess, and if everyone wishes to go to dinner afterwards: why, they may do so."
"Not sure what Manhattan is, come to think of it."
But could buy book of cocktails maybe.
Thursday 16 March
"9st 1, alcohol units 2, cigarettes 3 (v.g."
Jude Vile Richard
Tom Jerome (yuk)
Rebecca Martin Crashing Bore
What am I going to do?
Friday 17 March
So am just going to ask the following:
Magda and Jeremy
â€“ and cook supper for everyone myself.
"I said, over-compensating madly."
which means Vile Richard.
I mean nine is fine.
Next thing Sharon rang.
Just got home to icy offended-sounding answerphone message from Woney.
Realize I am going to spend my birthday cooking food for sixteen people.
Saturday 18 March
"8st 13,alcohol units 4(fed up),cigarettes 23(v.v.bad,esp.in two hours), Calories 3827 (repulsive)."
Just what I needed.
"she said breathily, steaming through my flat and heading for the kitchen."
You look about ninety.
Sunday 19 March
"8st 12 alcohol units 3, cigarettes 10, calories 2465 (but mainly chocolate)."
Have been talking to Jude about book she has been reading about festivals and rites of passage in primitive cultures and am feeling happy and serene.
"Realize it is shallow and wrong to feel that flat is too small to entertain nineteen, and that cannot be arsed to spend birthday cooking and would rather dress up and be taken to posh restaurant by sex-god with enormous gold credit card."
"Instead am going to think of my friends as a huge, warm, African, or possibly Turkish, family."
"Our culture is too obsessed with outward appearance, age and status."
Love is what matters.
These nineteen people are my friends; they want to be welcomed into my home to celebrate with affection and simple homely fare â€“ not to judge.
"It will be a marvellous, warm, Third-World-style ethnic family party."
Monday 20 March
"9st, alcohol units 4 (getting into mood), cigarettes 27 (hut last day before giving up), calories 2455."
"Have decided to serve the shepherds pie with Chargrilled Belgian Endive Salad, Roquefort Lardons and Frizzled Chorizo, to add a fashionable touch (have not tried before but sure it will be easy), followed by individual Grand, Marnier souffles, V. much looking forward to the birthday."
Expect to become known as brilliant cook and hostess.
Tuesday 21 March: Birthday
"9st, alcohol units 9,* cigarettes 42,* calories 4295."
"Have just stepped in a pan of mashed potato in new kitten-heel black suede shoes from Pied a terre (Pied-a-pomine-de-terre, more like), forgetting that kitchen floor and surfaces were covered in pans of mince and mashed potato."
It is already 6.30 and have to go out to Cullens for Grand Marnier souffle ingredients and other forgotten items.
Oh my God â€“ suddenly remembered tube of contraceptive jelly might be on side of washbasin.
Return with forgotten groceries.
Prepare Grand Marnier souffles.
"It is my birthday, after all.)"
Check plates and cutlery for tell-tale signs of sluttish washing-up and arrange in attractive fan shape.
"Ah, must buy napkins also (or is it serviettes?"
Can never remember which one is common)
Tidy up and move furniture to sides of room.
Make frisse lardon frizzled chorizo thing.
All of which leaves a clear half-hour to get ready so no need to panic.
Must have a fag.
How did that happen?
"7.15 p.m. Just, got back from shop and realize have forgotten butter,"
"7.35 p.m. Shit, shit shit."
is still in pans all over the kitchen floor and have not yet washed hair.
7.40 p.m. Oh my God.
Just looked for milk and realized have left the carrier bag behind in the shop.
Also had the eggs in it.
"Oh God, and the olive oil ."
so cannot do frizzy salad thing.
"Best plan, surely, is to get into the bath with a glass of champagne then get ready."
At least if I look nice I can carry on cooking when everyone is here and maybe can get Tom to go out for the missing ingredients.
Am in bra and pants with wet hair.
Pie is all over floor.
Suddenly hate the guests.
"Have had to slave for two days, and now they will all swan in, demanding food like cuckoos."
"At door were Magda, Tom, Shazzer and Jude with bottle of champagne."
"It turned out Magda had booked a big table at 192 and told everyone to go there instead of my flat, and there they all were waiting with presents, planning to buy me dinner."
"Magda said they had had a weird, almost spooky sixth sense that the Grand Marnier souffle and frizzled lardon thing were not going to work out."
"Love the friends, better than extended Turkish family in weird headscarves any day."
Stop being so neurotic and dreading things.
I will not
"Sleep with, or take any notice of, Daniel Cleaver any more."
Sunday 2 April
"9st, alcohol units 0 (marvellous), cigarettes 0, calories 2250."
"I read in an article that Kathleen Tynan, late."
"Kathleen Tynan would not, when late with a press release for Perpetua, lie fully dressed and terrified under the duvet, chain-smoking, glugging cold sake out of a beaker and putting on make-up as a hysterical displacement activity."
Kathleen Tynan would not allow Daniel Cleaver to sleep with her whenever he felt like it but not be her boyfriends Nor would she become insensible with drink and be sick.
"Wish to be like Kathleen Tynan (though not, obviously, dead)."
No fags for six days now.
"Have assumed air of dignified hauteur with Daniel and not messaged, flirted or slept with him for three weeks."
"Only three alcohol units consumed over the last week as grudging concession to Tom, who complained that spending the evening with the new vice-free me was like going out for dinner with a whelk, scallop or other flaccid sea-creature."
My body is a temple.
"It was my father, speaking in a weird, disconnected voice, almost as if he were a dalek."
I switched channels and lurched in horror.
"It was trailer for the Anne and Nick show and there, frozen in a video-effect diamond between Anne and Nick on the sofa, was my mother, all bouffed and made-up, as if she were Katie Bloody Boyle or someone."
"While Anne was speaking my mother unfroze within the diamond, which started whooshing towards the front of the screen, obscuring Anne and Nick, and revealing, as it did so, that my mother was thrusting a microphone under the nose of a mousy-looking woman."
It seems he is in denial and has convinced himself Mum is just having an end-of-life crisis and that she already realizes she has made a mistake but is too embarrassed to ask to come back.
The Alconburys are holding an Olde English supper on Saturday night for the Lifeboat.
Tuesday 4 April
"Determined, now, to tackle constant lateness for work and failure to address in-tray bulging with threats from bailiffs, etc."
Resolve to begin self-improvement programme with time-and-motion study.
7 a.m. Get weighed.
7.03 a.m. Return to bed in sulk over weight.
Sleeping or getting up equally out of question.
Hunger pains force self out of bed.
"Make coffee, consider grapefruit."
7.35-7.50 a.m. Look out of window.
7.55 a.m. Open wardrobe.
Try to find black Lycra miniskirt.
Pull clothes out of bottom of wardrobe in quest for skirt.
Go through drawers and search behind bedroom chair.
Go through ironing basket.
Go through dirty linen basket.
Have cigarette to cheer self up.
"8.20 a.m. Dry skin brushing (anti-cellulite), bath and hairwash."
Begin selection of underwear.
Laundry crisis means only available pants are vast white cotton.
"Too unattractive to contemplate, even for work (psychological damage)."
Go back to ironing basket.
Find unsuitably small black lacy pair â€“ prickly but better than giant Mummy-pant horror.
8.45 a.m. Start on black opaque tights.
Pair one seems to have Shrunk â€“ crotch is three inches above knees.
Get second pair on and find hole on back of leg.
Suddenly remember had Lycra mini-skirt on when returned home with Daniel last time.
Go to living room.
Triumphantly locate skirt between cushions on sofa.
8.55 a.m. Return to tights.
Pair three have hole only in toe.
Hole transforms into ladder which will protrude tellingly from shoe.
Go to ironing basket.
Locate last pair of black opaque tights twisted into rope-like object speckled with bits of tissue.
Untangle and purge of tissue.
9.05 a.m. Have got tights on now.
Suddenly realize hair is drying in weird shape.
Will not go right.
Spray with plant spray and blow some more.
9.40 a.m. Return to ironing and discover stubborn stain on front of shirt.
All other possible shirts dirty.
Try to wash out stain.
Entire shirt now soaking wet.
9.55 a.m. V. late now.
"In despair, have fag and read holiday brochure for calming five minutes."
Try to find handbag.
Decide to see if anything nice has come in the mail.
"10.07 a.m. Access letter only, about non-payment of minimum payment, Try to remember what was looking for."
Restart quest for handbag.
Suddenly remember had handbag in bedroom when looking for hairbrush but cannot find.
Eventually locate under clothes from wardrobe.
Return clothes to wardrobe.
Prepare to leave house.
Scour house in rage.
10.25 a.m. Find keys in handbag.
Realize have forgotten hairbrush.
10.35 a.m. Leave house.
Three hours and thirty-five minutes between waking and leaving house is too long.
In future must get straight up when wake and reform entire laundry system.
"Open up paper to read that convicted murderer in America is convinced the authorities have planted a microchip in his buttocks to monitor his movements, so to speak."
"Horrified by thought of similar microchip being in own buttocks, particularly in the mornings."
Wednesday 5 April
"She said, when you looked at life, Zen could be applied to anything â€“ Zen and the art of shopping, Zen and the art of flatbuying, etc."
She said that it was all a question of Flow rather than struggle.
"And if, for example, you had a problem or things were not working out, instead of straining or becoming angry you should just relax and feel your way into the Flow and everything would work out."
But not to mention idea to Sharon because she thought it was bollocks.
Thursday 6 April
"Waved at him and just for split second saw expression of horror cross his face, which instantly made me look to his companion who was a) not Magda."
"b) not yet thirty, c) wearing a suit which I have tried on twice in Whistles and had to take off as too expensive."
"I was about to play along with it but then I thought, hang on a minute!"
"What should I do now, though?"
"Oh dear, oh dear."
Ring Jeremy and threaten to tell Magda unless he drops the witch in my suit?
Mind my own business?
"Remembering Zen, Kathleen Tynan and Inner Poise, I did a version of Salute to the Sun I remembered from distant Yogacise class and centred myself, concentrating on the inner wheel, till the flow came."
"Then I resolved serenely to tell no one, as gossip is a virulent spreading poison."
"Then if, through"
"Flow, it seems the right thing to do, I will tell her what I saw."
Nothing of value comes through struggle; it is all about Flow.
Zen and the art of life.
"Hmmm, but then how did I happen to bump into Jeremy and the worthless trollop if not through Flow?"
"What does that mean, then?"
Tuesday 11 April
"8st alcohol units 0, cigarettes 0, Instants 9 (this must stop)."
All seems normal with Magda and Jeremy so maybe it was just a business meeting.
"Maybe the Zen and Flow notion is correct, for there is no doubt that by relaxing and going with the vibes I have done the right thing."
"Determined, instead of fearing the scary party, panicking all the way through and going home pissed and depressed, am going to improve social skills, confidence and Make Parties Work for Me â€“ as guided by article have just read in magazine."
Have you met the most dazzling person at the party apart from you?
"Wish to be like Tina Brown, though not, obviously, quite so hardworking."
The article is full of useful tips.
"One should never, apparently, talk to anyone at a party for more than two minutes."
When introducing people add a thoughtful detail or two about each person so that their interlocutor has a conversational kicking-off point.
Understand where have been going wrong by going to parties armed only with objective of not getting too pissed.
Monday 17 April
"8st12, alcohol units 0 (v.g."
Am going to work out clear set of objectives.
Will just watch adverts then ring up Jude.
"Anyway, will think of some more later."
Do not want to go to scary party.
Want to stay home with bottle of wine and watch Eastenders.
Tuesday 18 April
"9st7 (oh dear), cigarettes 30, calories (cannotbear to think about it), Instants 1 (excellent)."
Party got off to a bad start when could nor see anyone that I knew to introduce to each other.
Found myself a drink then spotted Perpetua talking to James from the Telegraph.
"I hung around for a while feeling a total git, then spotted Simon from Marketing."
in the style of Tina Brown.
"When I was almost there, however, I noticed that, unfortunately, Simon from Marketing was talking to Julian Barnes."
"I said, panicking wildly about what it was I could possibly want."
Simon and Julian Barnes looked at me expectantly.
Why did I say that?
I saw a faint smile hover over the thin-but-attractive lips of Julian Barnes.
"It was not going particularly well so far, there were no two ways about it."
I looked wistfully at the stairs.
"The thought of going home, putting my nightie on and turning on the telly began to seem irresistibly attractive."
"Perpetua was still by the door, talking to her ghastly friends Piggy and Arabella."
and held out her glass.
When I returned with three glasses of wine and a Perrier they were in full autowitter.
"said Perpetua sneerily, with a sideways glance at Arabella and Piggy."
I hate Perpetua when she gets like this.
Stupid old fartarse bag.
As I looked up I saw a dark-haired man in a suit straight in front of me.
I nearly opened my mouth and let all the sate sticks fall right out.
It was Mark Darcy.
But without the Arnold Palmer-style diamond-patterned sweater.
"Then, remembering the article, turned towards Perpetua."
"I began and then paused, frozen."
Perpetua is very fat and spends her whole time bossing me around?
Mark is very rich and has a cruel-raced ex-wife.
"said Arabella, opening her eyes very wide and blinking in a way she presumably thought was very attractive."
I had the feeling he was taking the piss out of me.
I could see her mentally fitting Mark Darcy and Natasha in with an array of Poohs and Piggies round the dinner table.
Mark Darcy looked as if he was going to burst out laughing.
she said with a resentful look in my direction.
I turned around.
He leaned over and kissed me.
"I saw you, though."
"Inner poise, I told myself, inner poise."
"Almost, when you examine it, thin to the point of transparency."
Has it ever occurred to you that your blouse might be suffering from .
Saturday 22 April
"8st 7, cigarettes, 0, alcohol units 0, calories 1800."
Today is a historic and joyous day.
After eighteen years of trying to get down to 8st 7 I have finally achieved it.
"It is no trick of the scales, but confirmed by jeans."
There is no reliable explanation.
"I have been to the gym twice in the last week, but that, though rare, is not freakish."
I have eaten normally.
It is a miracle.
"Rang Tom, who said maybe I have a tapeworm."
"The way to get rid of it, he said, is to hold a bowl of warm milk and a pencil in front of my mouth."
I love my new tapeworm.
"asked Tom in a suspicious, jealous tone."
But if you are single the last thing you want is your best friend forming a functional relationship with somebody else.
"I racked my brains, then stopped, shocked by a sudden, stunning realization."
I am not in love with Daniel anymore.
Tuesday 25 April
"8st 7, alcohol units 0 (excellent), cigarettes 0 (v.v.g."
asked Jude when I walked in.
"No, I just thought ."
Simon was the same.
Just a bit .
It continued all evening.
They might as well have done with it and say you look like five kinds of shit.
"I felt so pleased with myself for not drinking but as the evening wore on, and everyone got drunker, I began to feel so calm and smug that I was even irritating myself."
"I said to Jude at one point as she lurched past, hiccupping happily, at which point she collapsed into giggles, put her arm round me and fell over."
"Once there, I got into bed, put my head on the pillow but nothing happened."
Normally I would be snoring by now and having some sort of traumatized paranoid dream.
I put the light on.
It was only 11:30.
"Maybe I should do something, like, well, er ."
Inner poise The phone rang.
Now I feel empty and bewildered â€“ as if a rug has been pulled from under my feet.
Eighteen years â€“ wasted.
Eighteen years of calorieâ€“ and fat-unit-based arithmetic.
Eighteen years of buying long shirts and sweaters and leaving the room backwards in intimate situations to hide my bottom.
"Millions of cheesecakes and tiramisus, tens of millions of Emmenthal slices left uneaten."
"Eighteen years of struggle, sacrifice and endeavor â€“ for what?"
Thursday 27 April
"Alcohol units 0, cigarettes 0, Instants 12 (v.v."
"bad, but have not weighed self or thought about dieting all day; v.g.)."
"Must stop doing the Instants, but the trouble is I do quite often win."
"The Instants are much better than the Lottery itself, because the numbers no longer come up during Blind Date (it is not on at the moment) and all too often do not have a single one of yours among them, leaving you feeling both impotent and cheated with nothing to be done except crumple your ticket up and throw it defiantly on the floor."
"Three amounts the same secures a win, and in my experience you always get very close, often with as many as two matching pairs for amounts as great as ?50,000."
Friday 28 April
"Alcohol units 14, cigarettes 64, calories 8400 (v.g., though bad to have counted."
"Slimming obsession v. bad), Instants 0."
At 8:45 last night I was running a relaxing aromatherapy bath and sipping camomile tea when a car burglar alarm started up.
I have been waging a campaign on our street against car burglar alarms which are intolerable and counterproductive since you are more likely to get your car broken into by an angry neighbor trying to silence the burglar alarm than by a burglar
I picked up the intercom.
Then there was hysterical sobbing.
somebody yelled from an upstairs window.
"shrieked Magda, tugging at the car hood."
she yelled into the portable phone.
Magda is very posh.
Our street is not very posh.
"Magda and I were both in the car now, pulling every lever we could find, Magda swigging intermittently at a bottle of Laurent-Perrier."
By this time an angry mob was gathering.
"Next thing, Jeremy roared up on his Harley-Davidson."
"But instead of turning off the alarm, he started trying to grab the baby out of the backseat with Magda screaming at him."
"Then the Australian guy, Dan, who lives below me, opened his window."
Then Dan appeared m the hall.
"Several cigarettes and a lot of fiddling with a credit card later we were in, to find water flooding everywhere."
"Dan rushed downstairs, returning with a wrench and a bottle of Scotch."
"He managed to turn off the taps, and started helping me to mop up."
"Then the burglar alarm stopped and we rushed to the window just in time to see the Saab roar off, with the Harley-Davidson in hot pursuit."
Then suddenly a man in motorbike leathers appeared at the open door holding a pizza box.
Then the doorbell rang.
Then it rang without stopping.
I picked it up.
Why do I still fancy Daniel so much?
Saturday 29 April
"Alcohol units 12, cigarettes 57, calories 8489 (excellent)."
"Twenty-two hours, four pizzas, one Indian takeaway, three packets of cigarettes and three bottles of champagne later, Daniel is still here."
I am in love.
I am also now between one and all of the following:
a) Back on thirty a day.
Monday 1 May
"Alcohol units 0, cigarettes 0, calories 4200 (eating for two)."
I seriously think I am pregnant.
How could we have been so stupid?
"This morning I definitely felt the beginnings of morning sickness, but that could be because I was so hungover after Daniel finally left yesterday that I ate the following things to try to make myself feel better:"
2 packets Emmenthal cheese slices.
1 litre freshly squeezed orange juice.
1 cold jacket potato.
2 pieces unbaked lemon cheesecake (very light; also possibly eating for two).
1 Milky Way (125 calories only.
1 chocolate Viennoise dessert thing with cream on top (greedy baby incredibly demanding)
Steamed broccoli (attempt to nourish baby and stop it growing up spoilt).
"4 cold Frankfurter sausages, (only available tin in cupboard too exhausted by pregnancy to go out to shop again)."
"Am starting to get carried away with idea of self as Calvin Klein-style mother figure, poss."
"wearing crop-top or throwing baby in the air, laughing fulfilledly in advert for designer gas cooker, feel-good movie or similar."
"In the office today Perpetua was at her most obnoxious, spending 45 minutes on the phone to Desdemona, discussing whether yellow walls would look nice with pink-and-grey ruched blinds or whether she and Hugo should go for Blood Red with a floral freize."
"Instead of wanting to staple things to her head, I merely smiled in a beatific sort of way, thinking how soon all these things were to be immaterial to me, alongside caring for another tiny human being."
"Next I discovered a whole new world of Daniel fantasies: Daniel carrying the baby in a sling, Daniel rushing home from work, thrilled to find the two of us pink and glowing in the bath, and, in years to come, being incredibly impressive at parent/teacher evenings."
But then Daniel appeared.
"I have never seen him look worse, The only possible explanation was that on leaving me yesterday he had carried on drinking."
"He looked over at me, briefly, with the expression of an axe-murderer."
Wednesday 3 May
9st 2* (Eek.
"Baby growing at monstrous unnatural rate), alcohol units 0, cigarettes 0, calories 3100 (but mainly potatoes, oh my God)."
Thursday 4 May
"9stalcohol units 0, cigarettes 0, potatoes 12."
"I grabbed the proffered blue one, handed over the eight pounds sodding ninety-five and scuttled out."
For the first two hours this morning I kept staring at my handbag as if it was an unexploded bomb.
"At 11.30 I could stand it no longer, grabbed the handbag, got in the lift and went to the loo two floors down to avoid the risk of anyone I knew hearing suspicious rustling."
"For some reason, the whole business suddenly made me furious with Daniel."
"I unwrapped the packet in a fury, shoving the box and everything in the bin and getting on with it, then put the stick upside down on the back of the loo without looking at it."
"Three minutes, There was no way I was going to watch my fate being sealed by a slowly-forming thin blue line."
Somehow I got through those hundred and eighty seconds â€“ my last hundred and eighty seconds of freedom â€“ picked up the stick and nearly screamed.
"There in the little window was a thin blue line, bold as brass."
"After 45 minutes of staring blankly at the computer trying to pretend Perpetua was a Mexican cheeseplant whenever she asked me what was the matter, I bolted and went out to a phone booth to ring Sharon."
"I waited, feeling like a weird sort of hermaphrodite or Push-me-pull-you experiencing the most violently opposed baby sentiments of a man and a woman both at the same time."
"On the one hand I was all nesty and gooey about Daniel, smug about being a real woman â€“ so irrepressiblv fecund!"
"â€“ and imagining fluffy pink baby skin, a tiny creature to love, and darling little Ralph Lauren baby outfits."
"On the other I was thinking, oh my God, life is over, Daniel is a mad alcoholic and will kin me then chuck me when he finds out."
"No more nights out with the girls, shopping, flirting, sex, bottles of wine and fags."
"Instead I am going to turn into a hideous grow-bag-cum-milk-dispensing-machine which no one will fancy and which will not fit into any of my trousers, particularly my brand new acid-green Agnes B jeans."
"This confusion, I guess, is the price I must pay for becoming a modern woman instead of following the course nature intended by marrying Abnor Rimmington off the Northampton bus when I was eighteen."
"When Sharon arrived I sulkily thrust the pregnancy test with its tell-tale blue line, at her under the table."
There are supposed to be two lines.
This line is just to show the test is working.
Her nerves are shot to ribbons!
Friday 5 May
"9st (oh sod it, cannot break weighing habit of lifetime, particularly after pregnancy trauma â€“ will get therapy of some kindinfuture), alcohol units 6 (hurrah!"
Spent the morning mooning abut in mourning for lost baby but cheered up a bit when Tom called to suggest a lunchtime Bloody Mary to get the weekend off to a healthy start.
11.45 p.m. Daniel just called from Manchester.
Saturday 6 May: VE Day
"9st 1, alcohol units 6, cigarettes 25, calories 3800 (but celebrating anniversary of end of rationing), correct lottery numbers 0 (poor)."
"Awake on VE Day in unseasonable heatwave trying to whip up frenzy of emotion in self about end of war, freedom of Europe, marvellous, marvellous, etc."
"Feel extremely miserable about whole business, to tell truth."
I do not have any grandpas.
"Mum is going back to the street she was brought up in in Cheltenham for a whale-meat fritter party, probably with Julio."
None of my friends are organizing anything.
"It would seem embarrassingly enthusiastic and all wrong, somehow, suggesting a positive approach to life or that we were trying creepily to annex something that was nothing to do with us."
I was just nothing: while they were all fighting and making jam out of carrots or whatever they did.
I hate this idea and toy with calling Mum to see if she had started her periods when the war ended.
Could I have somehow sensed the end of the war as a stored egg?
If only I had a grandpa I could have got in on the whole thing under the guise of being nice to him.
"Oh, sod it, I am going to go shopping."
"The heat has made my body double -in size, I swear."
I am never going in a communal changing room again.
"I got a dress stuck under my arms in Warehouse while trying to lift it off and ended up lurching around with inside-out fabric instead of a head, tugging at it with my arms in the air, rippling stomach and thighs on full display to the assembled sniggering fifteen-year-olds."
When I tried to pull the stupid dress down and get out of it the other way it got stuck on my hips.
I hate communal changing rooms.
"to their obligatory obese friend, who looks like a water buffalo in everything."
"It was a disaster of a trip, anyway."
"I have come home with four things, all them unsuitable and unflattering."
One will be left behind the bedroom chair in an M amp;S bag for two years.
"The other three will be exchanged for credit notes from Boules, Warehouse, etc., which I will then lose."
"I have thus wasted ?119, which would have been enough to buy something really nice from Nicole Farhi, like a very small T-shirt."
"It is all a punishment, I realize, for being obsessed by shopping in a shallow, materialistic way instead of wearing the same rayon frock all summer and painting a line down the back of my legs; also for failing to join in the VE Day celebrations."
Maybe I should ring Tom and get a lovely party together for Bank Holiday Monday.
Is it possible to have kitsch ironic VE day party â€“ like for the Royal Wedding?
I wonder what would have happened if our generation had had a war?
"Ah well, time for a little drinkv."
Daniel will be here soon.
Hiding in kitchen having a fag.
Realized that our entire relationship so far has been based on the idea that one or other of us is supposed to be resisting having sex.
Spending an evening together when the idea was that we were supposed to have sex at the end of it was nothing short of bizarre.
Then when it was getting impossible to avoid the subject of bedtime any longer we went all formal and English.
"Then we ended up lying side by side and not touching, like we were Morecambe and Wise or John Noakes and Valerie Singleton in the Blue Peter House."
"If there is a God I would like to humbly ask Him â€“ whilst making it clear that I am deeply grateful for His suddenly turning Daniel inexplicably into a regular feature after so much fuckwittage â€“ to stop him getting into bed at night wearing pyjamas and reading glasses, staring at a book for 25 minutes then switching off the light and turning over â€“ and turn him back into the naked lust-crazed sex beast I used to know and love."
"Thanking you for your kind attention, Lord, regarding this matter."
Saturday 13 May
"9st 1lb 8oz, cigarettes 7, calories 1145, Instants 5 (won ?2 therefore total Instants expenditure only ?3 v.g."
Would welcome removal for thorough valeting.
"Still, was worth it for delicious night of drunken feminist ranting with Sharon and Jude."
1 tub hummus amp; pkt mini-pittas.
12 smoked salmon and cream cheese pinwheels.
1 tiramisu (party size).
2 Swiss Mountain Bars.
Sharon was on top form.
"she was already yelling by 8.35, pouring three-quarters of a glass of Kir Royale straight down her throat."
They exist in a total Culture of Entitlement.
"You see, I was going to bring this, sort of, date with me."
"exploded Sharon, beginning to turn pink."
"How dare he give himself license to treat you any way he likes under the name of friendship, then make himself feel clever by trying to upset you with his stupid new date."
"I shouted happily, tucking into another Silk Cut and a couple of salmon pinwheels."
By 11:30 Sharon was in full and splendid auto-rant.
"yelled Jude, slurping her Pinot Grigio."
"shouted Jude, lighting a Silk Cut with the butt end of the last one."
Just then the doorbell rang.
I yelled into the intercom.
I did ring earlier and leave a message on your answerphone.
"Then Daniel appeared up the stairs, smiling lovingly."
"He looked tired yet fresh-faced, clean-shaven and very neat in his suit."
He was holding three boxes of Milk Tray.
He carried eight Cullens carrier bags into the kitchen and started putting everything away.
At that moment the phone rang.
"As the girls fluttered around finding their handbags and grinning stupidly at Daniel, I started eating all the nut, praline, fudge or caramel-based chocolates out of my box of Milk Tray, feeling a bewildering mixture of smugness and pride over my perfect new boyfriend whom the girls clearly wished to have a go at shagging, and furious with the normally disgusting sexist drunk for ruining our feminist ranting by freakishly pretending to be the perfect man."
"I thought, while I waited for him to come back."
"When he came back he ran up the stairs, swept me up into his arms and carried me into the bedroom."
"he said, taking a foil-wrapped chocolate heart out of his pocket."
Sunday 14 May
Feels like homework night.
Have got to write catalogue copy for Perpetua before tomorrow.
Think I will just ring Jude first.
7.05 p.m. No reply.
"Anyway, down to work."
Think Will just call Sharon.
7.45 p.m. Shazzer was annoyed with me for ringing because she had just got in and was about to call 1471 to see if this guy she has been seeing had rung while she was out and now my number will be stored instead.
"Consider 1471 to be brilliant invention, instantly telling you the number of the last person who called."
"It was ironic, really, because when the three of us first found out about 1471 Sharon said she was totally against it, considering it exploitation by British Telecom of the addictive personalities and relationship-breakdown epidemic among the British populace."
Some people are apparently calling it upwards of twenty times a day.
Apparently in America the 1471 equivalent tells you all the numbers that have rung you since last time you checked and how many times.
"Jude says you have to be careful, though, because if you have an obsessive crush on someone and ring accidentally when they are in, then ring off and no number is stored they might guess it was you."
Must make sure Daniel does not find out about any of this.
9.30 p.m. Decided to nip round comer for cigarettes.
On way up stairs heard phone ringing.
"Suddenlv realizing had forgotten to put answerphone back on when Tom rang, tore up stairs, emptied contents of handbag on floor to find key and threw self across from to phone at which point phone stopped."
Had just gone into loo when phone rang again.
Stopped when got to it.
Then started ringing again when went away.
Thought better of boasting to her about having a boyfriend despite being dressed from head to toe in slurry but prospect of Daniel and self becoming hot topic for discussion precipitating relentless stream of feedback folk-wisdom from Mum dissuaded me.
Eventually got her to shut up about Color Me Beautiful by telling her I would think about it.
Tuesday 17 May
9st 2 (hooray!
Daniel is still being gorgeous.
How could everyone have been so wrong about him?
"Head is full of moony fantasies about living in flats with him and running along beaches together with tiny offspring in manner of Calvin Klein advert, being trendy Smug Married instead of sheepish Singleton."
Just off to meet Magda.
"Thought-provoking supper with Magda, who is v. depressed about Jeremy."
"The night of the burglar alarm and screaming row in my street was a result of a remark from Sloaney Woney, who claimed she had seen Jeremy with a girl at the Harbour Club who sounded suspiciously like the witch I saw him with all those weeks ago."
But Magda was really fed up.
"When Jeremy comes home at the end of the day he wants to put his feet up and be nurtured and, as I imagine all the time now, fantasize about girls in leotards at the Harbour Club."
I watched her toying with her champagne glass despondently and wondered what the answer is for we girls.
Talk about grass is always bloody greener.
"God, I so much wish I was like you, Bridge, and could just have an affair."
"Or have bubble bath, for two hours on Sunday morning."
Or stay out all night with no questions asked.
I thought about my Mum.
Go back to work.
Friday 19 May
8st 12 1/2(have lost 3lb 8oz literally overnight â€“ must have eatenfood which uses up more calories to eat it than it gives off e.g.
"v. chewy Lettuce), alcohol units 4(modest), cigarettes 21 (bad),Instants 4 (not v.g.)."
But then vanity began to get the better of me.
I could hear office noises in the background.
There was a pause.
I could hear her talking to someone in the background.
"Remember, I gave you the gift of life."
Where would you be without me?
Saturday 20 May
9st 3 (why?
"By the time we finally got going, with Mother and I sitting opposite each other in semidarkness, it was nearly half past one."
I stared at her incredulously.
I was too livid to speak.
I kicked her back and she jumped and let out a little noise.
"she said, handing me a tissue."
At this point there was a loud snort of laughter from the back of the room.
Sunday 21 May
My mum is not speaking to either of us for humiliating her and exposing her as a fraud in front of her crew.
At least she might leave us alone for a bit now.
"So much looking forward to the summer, anyway."
Will be so lovely having a boyfriend when it is warm.
We will be able to go on romantic mini-breaks.
Saturday 3 June
"8st13,alcohol units 5,cigarettes 25, calories 600, minutes spent looking at brochures: long-haul 45, mini-break 87, 1471calls 7 (g.)."
Finding it impossible to concentrate on almost anything in the heat except fantasies about going on mini-breaks with Daniel.
"Head is filled with visions of us lying in glades by rivers, me in long white floaty dress, Daniel and I sitting outside ancient Cornish waterside pub sipping pints in matching striped T-shirts and watching the sun set over the sea; Daniel and I eating candlelit dinners in historic country-house-hotel courtyards then retiring to our room to shag all hot summer night."
It is marvellous having a boyfriend.
Sunday 4 June
"9st,alcoholunits 3(g.), cigarettes 13 (g.), Minutesspent looking at brochures:long-haul 30 (g.), mini-break 52,1471 calls 3 (g.)."
Daniel has just gone home.
"Bit fed up, actually."
"Was really lovely hot Sunday but Daniel did not want to go out or discuss mini-breaks and insisted on spending all afternoon with the curtains drawn, watching the cricket."
"Also the party was quite nice last night, but at one point we went over to join Wicksy and a very pretty girl he was talking to."
"I did notice, as we approached, that she looked rather defensive."
Quite like leaning out of the window.
"Think would like to move to New York: though probably, come to think of it, not v. g. area for mini-breaks."
"Unless mini-break actually is to New York, which would be pointless if one were already in New York."
Will just ring Tom then get down to work.
8 p.m. Just going round to Tom for a quick drink.
Just for half an hour.
Tuesday 6 June
"9st 2, alcoholunits 4, cigarettes 3(v.g."
Managed to persuade Perpetua to let me stay at home to work.
Certain she only agreed because she wants to sunbathe too.
Going through all pages one by one imagining Daniel and me being alternately sexual and romantic in all the bedrooms and dining rooms.
"Right: am going to, concentrate now."
"11.25 a.m. Hmmm, got a bit of a scratchy nail."
I just started having paranoid fantasy for no reason about Daniel having an affair with someone else and thinking up dignified but cutting remarks to make him sorry.
Now why should that be?
The trouble with trying to go out with people when you get older is that everything becomes so loaded.
"When you are partnerless in your thirties, the mild bore of not being in a relationship â€“ no sex, not having anyone to hang out with on Sundays, going home from parties on your own all the time â€“ gets infused with the paranoid notion that the reason you are not in a relationship is your age, you have had your last ever relationship and sexual experience ever, and it is all your fault for being too wild or wilful to settle down in the first bloom of youth."
"The whole thing builds up out of all proportion, so finding a relationship seems a dazzling, almost insurmountable goal, and when you do start going out with someone it cannot possibly live up to expectations."
Or is it that there is something wrong with me being with Daniel?
Is Daniel having an affair?
Nail really is scratchy.
"Come to think of it, this nail varnish generally is looking a bit scrotty."
I really need to take it all off and start again.
Might as well do it now while I think about it.
"Feel he thinks I am trying to trap him into a mini-break; as if it were not a mini-break but marriage, three kids and cleaning out the toilet in house full of stripped pine in Stoke Newington."
I think this is turning into a psychological crisis.
"Tom says if you go mini-breaking with somebody you are having a relationship with you spend the whole time worrying about how the relationship is going, so it is better just to go with a friend."
"Apart from sex, I say."
"Apart from sex, he agrees."
So I must work really hard this afternoon.
These shorts and T-shirt are too uncomfortable in this heat.
"Oh dear, my pants show through this dress now."
"Now, my Gossard Glossies ones would be perfect."
I wonder where they are.
In fact think might put the Glossiesâ€“ bra on to match if I can find it.
At last a bit of time off.
"2 p.m. OK, so this afternoon I am really going to work and get everything done before the evening, then can go out."
Catnaps are said to be an excellent way of reviving oneself.
Used to excellent effect by Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill.
"7.30 p.m. Oh, Bloody Hell."
Friday 9 June
"9st 2,alcohol units7, cigarettes 22, calories 2145, minutesspent inspecting face for wrinkles 230."
Night out with girls tonight.
7 p.m. Oh no.
Turns out Rebecca is coming.
"An evening with Rebecca is like swimming in sea with jellyfish: all will be going along perfectly pleasantly then suddenly you get painful lashing, destroying confidence at stroke."
Sharon says am not twenty-four any more and should be mature enough to deal with Rebecca.
Saturday 10 June
"said Rebecca, then left a long, embarrassed pause."
I felt the blood draining from my brain as the horrible truth of what Rebecca was saying hit me.
"I grasped the table for support, trying to get my breath."
"I am ageing prematurely, I realized."
Like a time-release film of a plum turning into a prune.
"Instead of denying it, Jude and Shazzer were accepting my premature ageing as read, tactfully trying to change the subject to spare my feelings."
"I sat, in a spiral of terror, grasping my sagging face."
"Once in front of the mirror I reeled as the harsh overhead lighting revealed my thick, age-hardened, sagging flesh."
"I imagined the others back at the table, chiding Rebecca for alerting me to what everyone had long been saying about me but I never needed to know."
Once get on tack of thinking about ageing there is no escape.
"Life suddenly seems like holiday where, halfway through, everything starts accelerating towards the end."
"Feel need to do something to stop ageing process, but what?"
Caught in hideous cleft stick as both fatness and dieting are in themselves ageing.
Why do I look old?
Stare at old ladies in street trying to work out all tiny processes by which faces become old not young.
"Scour newspapers for ages of everyone, trying to decide if they look old for their age."
"It was Simon, to tell me about the latest girl he has got his eye on."
"I said, suspiciously,"
Have reached the age when men of my own age no longer find their contemporaries attractive.
Going out to meet Tom for tea.
"Decided needed to spend more time on appearance like Hollywood stars and have therefore spent ages putting concealer under eyes, blusher on cheeks and defining fading features."
"I started blinking very rapidly, trying to come to terms with the realization that some hideous time-bomb in my skin had suddenly, irrevocably, shrivelled it up."
I glanced in the mock Victorian pub mirror.
"I looked like a garish clown with bright pink cheeks, two dead crows for eyes and the bulk of the white cliffs of Dover smeared underneath."
Suddenly understood how old women end up wandering around over-made-up with everyone sniggering at them and resolved not to snigger any more.
Even though suspected he might have been lying still feel hugely cheered up as even Tom would surely not say looked sixteen if looked forty-five.
Sunday 11 June
"8st13(v.g,too hot to eat),alcohol units 3, cigarettes0 (v. g.,too hot to smoke), calories 759 (entirely ice-cream)."
It seems the entire summer is doomed to be spent watching the cricket with the curtains drawn.
Feel strange sense of unease with the summer and not just because of the drawn curtains on Sundays and mini-break ban.
"Realize, as the long hot days freakishly repeat themselves, one after the other, that whatever I am doing I really think I ought to be doing something else."
"It comes from the same feeling family as the one which periodically makes you think that just because you live in central London you should be out at the RSC/Albert Hall/ Tower of London/Royal Academy/Madame Tussauds, instead of hanging around in bars enjoying yourself."
"The more the sun shines the more obvious it seems that others are making fuller, better use of it elsewhere: possibly at some giant softball game to which everyone is invited except me; possibly alone with their lover in a rustic glade by waterfalls where Bambis graze, or at some large public celebratory event, probably including the Queen Mother and one or more of the football tenors, to mark the exquisite summer which I am failing to get the best out of."
Maybe it is our climatic past that is to blame.
"Maybe we do not yet have the mentality to deal with a sun and cloudless blue sky, which is anything other than a freak incident."
"The instinct to panic, run out of the office, take most of your clothes off and lie panting on the fire escape is still too strong."
"But there, too, is confusion."
It is not the thing to go out courting malignant growths any more so what should you do?
"A shady barbecue, perhaps?"
Starve your friends while you tamper with fire for hours then poison them with burnt yet still quivering slices of underdone suckling pig?
"Or organize picnics in the park and end up with all the women scraping squashed gobbets of mozzarella off tinfoil and yelling at children with ozone asthma attacks; while the men swig warm white wine in the fierce midday sun, staring at the nearby softball games with left-out shame."
"Envy summer life on the Continent, where men in smart lightweight suits and designer sunglasses glide around calmly in smart air-conditioned cars, maybe stopping for a citron presse in a shady pavement cafe in an ancient square, totally cool about the sun and ignoring it because they know for a fact that it will still be shining at the weekend, when they can go and lie quietly on the yacht."
Feel certain this has been factor behind our waning national confidence ever since we started to travel and notice it.
I suppose things might change.
More and more tables are on pavements.
Monday 12 June
"9st 1, alcohol units 3 (v.g."
7 p.m. Mum just rang.
Ursula was in the year above you at the High School.
Herbert died of leukaemia .
Ridiculous to have had video for two years and never to have been able to make it record anything.
Also is marvellous FV 67 HV VideoPlus.
"Simple matter of following operating instructions, locating buttons, etc., certain."
Cannot locate operating instructions.
Found operating instructions under Hello!
But what are IMC functions?
Decide to ignore that page.
Hate the stupid video.
Feel exactly the same as feel when trying to follow signposts on roads.
Know in heart that signposts and video manual do not make sense but still cannot believe authorities would be so cruel as to deliberately dupe us all.
Feel incompetent fool and as if everyone else in world understands something which is being kept from me.
Press red and nothing happens.
Press numbers and nothing happens.
Wish stupid video had never been invented.
Realize was using telly remote control by mistake.
Now news has come on.
"Suddenly there is clicking noise within video and the news is replaced, incomprehensibly, by Blind Date."
Newsnight in 15 minutes.
Cassette will not go in.
"10.18 p.m. Ah, Thelma and Louise is in there."
10.19 p.m.Thelma and Louise will not come out.
10.21 p.m. Frenziedly press all buttons.
Cassette comes out and goes back in again.
10.25 p.m. Have got new cassette in now.
"now ""would"" you see, in 1570 ."
10.31 p.m. OK. OK.
"10.33 p. Yesss, yesss."
Cassette has started rewinding and now stopped and ejected.
Realize in excitement have sat on remote control.
"Have rung Shazzer, Rebecca, Simon, Magda."
Nobody knows how to programme their videos.
Only person I know who knows how to do it is Daniel.
10.45 p.m. Oh God.
Daniel fell about laughing when said I could not programme video.
Said he would do it for me.
"Still, at least have done best for Mum."
11.30 p.m. Daniel just called.
Sunday 8 June
"8st 12, alcohol units 3, cigarettes 17."
Nice country house hotel.
Wednesday 21 June
8st 11 (v.v.g.
"Daniel has refused to discuss the mini-break any more, or look at the brochure, and has forbidden me from mentioning it until we actually set off on Saturday."
How can he expect me not to be excited when I have been longing for this for so long?
"Why is it that men have not yet learnt to fantasize about holidays, choose them from brochures and plan and fantasize about them in the way that they (or some of them) have learnt to cook or sew?"
The singlehanded mini-break responsibility is hideous for me.
Sunday 25 June
"8st 11, alcohol units 7, cigarettes 2, calories 4587 (ooops)."
"Daniel decided the place was nouveau from the moment we arrived, because there were three Rolls-Royces parked outside, and one of them yellow."
I was fighting a sinking realization that it was suddenly freezing cold and I had packed for 900 heat.
This was my packing:
Long floaty white dress 1.
Trailer-park-trash pink jelly mules 1 pair.
Tea-rose-pink suede mini dress 1.
"Bras, pants, stockings, suspenders (various)."
"There was a crack of thunder as I teetered, shivering, after Daniel to find the foyer stuffed with bridesmaids and men in cream suits and to discover that we were the only guests staying in the hotel who were not in the wedding party."
Suddenly I had the unmistakable feeling that Daniel was trying to change the subject.
I thought Daniel was going to hit him.
"Instead of lying side by side with Daniel in hot sun at the side of the lake wearing a long floaty dress, I ended up blue with cold in a rowing boat with one of the hotel bath towels wrapped round me."
"Eventually we gave up to retire to our room for a hot bath and Codis, discovering en route that another couple were to be sharing the non-wedding party dining room with us that evening, the female half of which was a girl called Eileen whom Daniel had slept with twice, inadvertently bitten dangerously hard on the breast and never spoken to since."
As I emerged from my bath Daniel was lying on the bed giggling.
All you do is not eat any food which you have to pay for.
Then you lose weight and get a bit leggy and shag-me hippy and people start taking you out for meals.
I keep telling you nobody wants legs like a stick insect.
"I was torn between a gross image of myself with a bicycle parked in my bottom and a pint of beer balanced on it, fury at Daniel for his blatantly provocative sexism and suddenly wondering if he might be right about my concept of my body in relationâ€“ to men, and, in which case, whether I should have something delicious to eat straight away and what that might be."
Seconds later the room was in complete darkness apart from the flickering light of the cricket.
Daniel had lit a fag and was calling down to room service for six cans of Fosters.
Sunday 2 July
"8st 10 (continuing good work), alcohol units 0, cigarettes 0, calories 995, Instants 0: perfect."
7.45 a.m. Mum just rang.
There was a slight pause.
Sometimes I think my mother is part of the modern world and sometimes she seems a million miles away.
"I tried hard not to, fighting off a vision of Una Alconbury in thigh boots, fishnet nights and a peephole bra."
For sixty-year-olds to organize such an event seemed unnatural and wrong.
My heart sank at the thought of my relationship with Daniel being dissected in dose and intimate detail amongst the Lifeboat luncheons of Northamptonshire.
When I retrieved the phone my mother was still talking.
Daniel was standing stark naked in the doorway.
I like it when he is authoritative without being cross like this.
I could practically hear her going all fluttery.
"Yes, it is an absolutely beautiful day."
He looked at me while she chattered for a few seconds then turned back to the receiver.
I shall put that in the diary for the twenty-ninth and look out my dog collar.
"You take care of yourself, now."
Saturday 22 July
"8st 11 (hmm must get 1lb off), alcohol units 2, cigarettes 7, calories 1562."
Actually I am really excited about Daniel coming to the Tarts and Vicars party with me next Saturday.
It will be a gorgeous hot day.
Maybe we could even make a mini-break of it and stay in a pub (or other hotel without televisions in the bedroom).
I hope he likes him.
I expected Daniel to at least be sympathetic.
Friday 28 July
"8st 12 (must do diet before tomorrow), alcohol units I (v.g."
Daniel was really sweet tonight and spent ages helping me choose my outfit for the Tarts and Vicars.
He kept suggesting different ensembles for me to try on while he weighed it up.
It was really good of him to give up the time.
Sometimes I think he really is quite caring.
He seemed particularly keen on sex tonight as well.
"Ooh, I am so looking forward to tomorrow."
Saturday 29 July
8st 11 9v.g.
Cannot believe what has happened.
By 1 p.m. Daniel had still not woken up and I was starting to worry because the party starts at 2.30.
He promised to come.
Cannot believe what I have been through.
"As I started to cross the lawn they all went quiet, and I realized to my horror that instead of Tarts and Vicars, the ladies were in Country Casuals-style calf-length floral two-pieces and the men were in slacks and V-necked sweaters."
"I stood there, frozen, like, well, a rabbit."
"Then while everyone stared, Una Alconbury came flapping across the lawn in pleated fuchsia holding out a plastic tumbler full of bits of apple and leaves."
Super to see you.
"I mean, did she think I dressed as a bunny girl normally or something?"
"said Uncle Geoffrey, lurching over, pissed."
because everyone thought vicars were tarts anyway.
Beside him was the tall thin glamorous top family-law barrister clad in a demure lilac dress and coat like Jackie O. with sunglasses on her head.
The smug witch smirked at Mark and blatantly looked me up and down in a most impolite manner.
"trilled my mother, hurrying towards us in a bright turquoise pleated shirtwaister, waving a clapper board."
You look like a common prostitute.
"Absolute quiet, please, everyone, aaaaand ."
"I saw Mark Darcy talking to Una and gesturing in my direction then Una, looking purposeful, hurried across to me."
Another glass of Pimms?
All this was said very aggressively as if Una was taking as a personal insult the fact that Mark had chosen a girlfriend who was a) not me and b) had not been introduced to him by Una at a turkey curry buffet.
"said Mark, looking surprised."
"He stared at me, as if distracted by something else."
Are you suggesting that I am jealous of Daniel Cleaver?
"After 45 minutes more horror I thought I could decently leave, pleading work to Una."
I had to have a cigarette in the car for five minutes before I was calm enough to set off.
"Sitting next to him in the front seat was Penny Husbands-Bosworth, wearing a red lace underwired uplift basque, and two bunny ears."
"There was I no answer when I rang, so I left it a while and rang again in case it was just in the middle of a really good wicket or something."
I looked up at his window and there was Daniel.
"I beamed at him, waved and pointed at the door."
"He disappeared, I assumed to press the buzzer, so I rang the bell again."
"But when I looked round, there he was again, not on the phone, but watching me out of the window."
"Cunning as a fox, I pretended not to see and kept walking, but inside I was in turmoil."
Why was he watching?
Suddenly it hit me like a thunderbolt.
He was with a woman.
"My heart pounding, I rounded the corner, then, keeping flat against the wall, I peered round to check he had gone from the window."
No sign of him.
"I hurried back and assumed a crouching position in the porch next to his, observing his doorway between the pillars in case a woman came out."
"I waited, crouched in the position for some time."
What would I do?
"Also, what was to stop him leaving the woman in the flat with instructions to stay there until he had had time to get to the pub?"
I looked at my watch.
"Emboldened, I hurried back towards the door and pushed the buzzer."
Did I hear a voice in the background?
"In denial, I told myself he was just laundering money or dealing in drugs."
He was probably trying to hide polythene bags full of cocaine under the floorboards helped by some smooth South American men with ponytails.
He was playing for time I could tell.
Maybe it was a slight smell .
something about the way Daniel was behaving.
"Whatever it was, I just knew."
We stood there warily at opposite sides of the sitting room.
I was just desperate to start running around opening and dosing all the cupboards like my mother and ringing 1471 to see if there was a number stored from America.
I needed to get him into the kitchen so I could go through all the cupboards.
"He looked at me for a moment, then set off into the kitchen at which I quickly leapt across the room to look behind the sofa and the curtains."
Daniel was standing in the doorway-
He looked suspicious and headed off to the kitchen again.
"Deciding there was no time to dial 1471, I quickly checked the cupboard where he keeps the duvet for the sofabed â€“ no human habitation â€“ then followed him to the kitchen, pulling open the door of the hall cupboard as I passed at which the ironing board fell out, followed by a cardboard box full of old 45s which slithered out all over the floor."
"said Daniel mildly again, coming out of the kitchen."
Instead I locked the loo door and started frantically looking around for things.
There was someone in the room.
"It was Daniel, defensively holding a pair of jeans in front of him."
"I leaned my head on his chest and put my arms around him, trying to smell his shirt for perfume traces and get a good look at the bed, which was unmade as usual."
"he said, starting to unzip the bridesmaid dress and pressing against me in a way which made his intentions very clear."
I suddenly thought this might be a trick and he was going to seduce me while the woman slipped out unnoticed.
"Usually once he gets going he will see things through to their logical conclusion come earthquake, tidal wave or naked pictures of Virginia Bottomley on the television."
As I did so I suddenly caught sight of the door that led up to the roof terrace.
he said as I stared at the door suspiciously.
If we then went up on the roof she would be able to escape.
"But if that was the case, surely Daniel would have suggested going up on the roof much sooner."
"He brought me a cup of tea and sat down at his laptop, which was open and turned on."
Only then did I start to think that maybe there was no woman.
There was a document up on the screen â€“ maybe he really had been working and on the phone to America.
And I was making a complete prat of myself behaving like a madwoman.
I felt a complete fool.
It was bloody Mark Darcy trying to wreck my relationship by sowing suspicions in my mind.
"Poor Daniel, it was so unfair to doubt him in this way, because of the word of some arrogant, ill-tempered, topflight human-rights lawyer."
Then I heard a scraping noise on the roof above us.
"he yelled, moving to bar my path, but I was too quick for him."
"I dodged past, opened the door, ran up the stairs and opened the hatch out into the sunlight."
"There, spread out on a sunlounger, was a bronzed, long-limbed, blonde-haired stark-naked woman."
"I stood there frozen to the spot, feeling like an enormous pudding in the bridesmaid dress."
"The woman raised her head, lifted her sunglasses and looked at me with one eye closed."
I heard Daniel coming up the stairs behind me.
Tuesday 1 August
"8st 12, alcohol units 3, cigarettes 40 (but have stopped inhaling in order to smoke more), calories 450 (off food),1471 calls 14, Instants 7."
My boyfriend is sleeping with a bronzed giantess.
My mother is sleeping with a Portuguese.
"Jeremy is sleeping with a horrible trollop, Prince Charles is sleeping with Camilla Parker-Bowles."
Do not know what to believe in or hold on to anymore.
"Feel like ringing Daniel in hope he could deny everything, come up with plausible explanation for the clothes-free rooftop valkyrie â€“ younger sister, friendly neighbor recovering from flood or similar â€“ which would make everything all right."
Should have gone to stay with Tom as suggested.
"Hate being alone in middle of night, smoking and sniveling like mad psychopath."
Fear Dan downstairs might hear and ring loony bin.
Why does nothing ever work out?
It is because I am too fat.
Toy with ringing Tom again but only called him forty-five minutes ago.
Cannot face going into work.
"Daniel had left three messages when I got back, asking me to call him."
Used to think he was cynical and wrong but I think I was nice to Daniel and look what happened.
"Oh God, birds have started singing."
Have to go to work in three and a half hours.
Have suddenly had brainwave: ring Mum.
10 a.m. Mum was brilliant.
"Yes, that does include you, Julio."
"Now come along, darling."
Go into work looking drop-dead gorgeous.
Made a complete silly fool of himself trying to attract my attention.
"What did she think she looked like, a hamster or something?"
"Let me give you my direct line, darling."
He has to work with you.
"Prepare to hand in your notice, kid."
Am just off to work looking like Ivana bloody Trump wearing a suit and lip gloss.
Wednesday 2 August
"8st 12., thigh circumference 18 inches, alcohol units 3 (but v. pure sort of wine), cigarettes 7 (but did not inhale), calories 1500 (excellent), teas 0, coffees 3 (but made with real coffee beans therefore less cellulite-inducing), total caffeine units 4."
Am going to get down to 8st 7lb again and free thighs entirely of cellulite.
Certain everything will be all right then.
Have embarked on intensive detoxification program involving no tea no coffee no alcohol no white flour no milk and what was it?
This last bit puzzles me â€“ does the anticellulite oil actually soak into the cellulite through the skin?
"In which case, if you put self-tanning lotion on does that mean you get suntanned cellulite inside?"
Or a suntanned lymphatic drainage system?
That was the other thing.
Thursday 3 August
"8st 11, thigh circumference 18 inches (honestly, what is bloody point), alcohol units 0, cigarettes 25 (excellent, considering), negative thoughts: approx."
"445 per hour, positive thoughts 0."
Head state v. bad again.
Cannot bear thought of Daniel with someone else.
Mind is full of horrid fantasies about them doing things together.
"The plans to lose weight and change personality kept me aloft for two days, only to collapse around my ears."
I realize it was only a complicated form of denial.
"Unfortunately, I now realize the whole point of the aloof over-made-up ice-queen on anticellulite diet palaver was to make Daniel realize the error of his ways."
Tom did warn me of this and said 90 percent of plastic surgery was done on women whose husbands had run off with a younger woman.
Daniel kept sending me computer messages at work.
"But the more he sent the more I got carried away, imagining that the self-reinvention was working, that he realized he had made a terrible, terrible mistake, had only now understood how much he truly loved me, and that the rooftop giantess was history."
Tonight he caught up with me outside the office as I was leaving.
Instead he looked rather cross.
"I stared at him, astonished at the audacity of his volte-face."
Friday 4 August
"Thigh circumference 18 inches, negative thoughts 600 per minute, panic attacks 4, crying attacks 12 (but both times only in toilets and remembered to take mascara), Instants 7."
This is just .
What on earth possessed me to think it was a good idea to have an affair with my boss?
Cannot deal with it out there.
Daniel has announced his engagement to the giantess.
I keep remembering how romantic it was when we started and it was all secret computer messages and trysts in the lift.
Am seriously considering face-lift.
Tuesday 8 August
"9st, alcohol units 7 (har har), cigarettes 29 (tee hee), calories 5 million, negative thoughts 0, thoughts, general 0."
"I told her a bit about the tragedy with Daniel and she was horrified, immediately declared a state of emergency and said she would call Sharon and fix for us all to meet at nine."
2 a.m. Gor es wor blurry goofun tonight though.
Wednesday 9 August
"9st 2 (but in good cause), thigh circumference 16 inches (either miracle or hangover error), alcohol units 0 (but body still drinking units from last night), cigarettes 0 (ugh)."
In physically disastrous state but emotionally v. much cheered up by night out.
Jude arrived in vixen-from-hell fury because Vile Richard had stood her up for the Relationship Counseling.
"Actually, I have a commitment problem."
"I said, intrigued, immediately thinking maybe I had a commitment problem."
are looking for researchers.
"Current affairs, terribly good."
"I said you had a degree in politics, darling."
That only gives me five days to learn Current Affairs.
Saturday 12 August
"9st 3 (still in very good cause), alcohol units 3 (v.g."
"bad, particularly since first day of giving up), calories 1800 (g.), lottery tickets 4 (fair), no."
"of serious current affairs articles read 1.5, 1471 calls 22 (OK), minutes spent having cross imaginary conversations with Daniel 120 (v.g."
Determined to be v. positive about everything.
"Am going to change life: become well informed re: current affairs, stop smoking entirely and form functional relationship with adult man."
Still have not had fag.
8:35 a.m. No fags all day.
8:40 a.m. Wonder if anything nice has come in post?
Hateful document from Social Security Agency asking for ?1452.
How can this be?
Have not got ?1432.
"Oh God, need fag to calm nerves."
8:47 a.m. Just had fag.
But no-smoking day does not start officially till have got dressed.
"Suddenly start thinking of former boyfriend Peter with whom had functional relationship for seven years until finished with him for heartfelt, agonizing reasons can no longer remember."
Every so often â€“ usually when he has no one to go on holiday with â€“ he tries to get back together and says he wants us to get married.
"Before know where am, am carried away with idea of Peter being answer."
Why be unhappy and lonely when Peter wants to be with me?
"Quickly find telephone, ring Peter and leave message on his answerphone-merely asking him to give me call rather than whole plan of spending rest of life together, etc."
1:15 p.m. Peter has not rung back.
"Am repulsive to all men now, even Peter."
No-smoking policy in tatters.
V. bad feeling in pancreas area.
"Exes should never, never go out with or marry other people but should remain celibate to the end of their days in order to provide you with a mental fallback position."
Have just smoked entire packet of Silk Cut as act of self-annihilating existential despair.
Hope they both become obese and have to be lifted out of the window by crane.
Trying to concentrate hard on memorizing names of Shadow Cabinet to avoid spiral of self-doubt.
Realize with sinking humiliation that reason have been feeling smug about Peter all these years was that I finished with him and now he is effectively finishing with me by marrying Mrs.
"She was wearing a lime green suit, black tights and highheeled court shoes."
She looked like Cilla Black on Blind Date.
"she said, banging cupboard doors."
"I began, but then her handbag started ringing."
She was balancing a portable phone under her chin now and scribbling.
"Now I have missed the news and she has gone off to a Cheese and Wine party, leaving me looking like a door-to-door cosmetics saleswoman in a bright blue suit with slithery green blouse underneath and blue eyeshadow right up to my eyebrows."
He led us excitedly across the big white space to a toilet paper roll: inside out with the cardboard outside the paper.
They looked at me expectantly.
Suddenly I knew I was going to cry.
Tom was now drooling over a giant bar of soap bearing the imprint of a penis.
Gav was staring at me.
"There was a queue outside a Portaloo, and I joined it, shaking."
"Suddenly, just when it was almost my turn, I felt a hand on my arm."
"I burst into the cubicle and was just about to get on with it when I realized the toilet was actually a molding of the inside of a toilet, vacuum-packed in plastic."
Then Daniel put his head round the door.
"he said, and closed the door again."
When I came out he had vanished.
Tom was waiting outside..
Then he took one look at my face and said.
How can you not be left with the personal confidence of a passed-over British Rail sandwich?
Sunday 13 August
V. bad night.
Made me even more depressed in way cannot quite fathom.
Am going to stop feeling sorry for myself and spend morning learning newspapers by heart.
"Yes, I saw Peter last night ."
and he was telling everyone how upset you were about the wedding.
"As he said, it is difficult, single women do tend to get desperate as they get older ."
"By lunchtime could no longer go on with Sunday, trying to pretend everything was OK."
"Rang up Jude and told her about Waspy, Rebecca, job interview, Mum, Daniel and general misery and arranged to meet at Jimmy Beez at two for a Bloody Mary."
"6 p.m. As luck would have it, Jude had just been reading brilliant book called Goddesses in Everywoman."
"What you have to do is be a heroine and stay brave, without sinking into drink or self-pity and everything will be OK. And that all the Greek myths and many successful movies are all about human beings facing difficult trials and not being wimps but holding hard and thus coming Out on top."
The book also says that coping with difficult times is like being in a conical shell-shaped spiral and there is a point at each turn that is very painful and difficult.
That is your particular problem or sore spot.
"When you are at the narrow, pointy end of the spiral you come back to that situation very often as the rotations are quite small."
Trouble is now I have sobered up not sure I am 100 percent sure what she was talking about.
Monday 14 August
"9st 5 (great-turned into lard mountain for interview, also have spot), alcohol units 0, cigarettes many, calories 1575 (but threw up so effectively 400, approx.)."
I have told Perpetua I am at the gynecologist â€“ I know I should have said dentist but opportunities to torture the nosiest woman in the world must not be allowed to slip through the net.
"Oh fuck, oh flick."
Is it someone with a beard?
Will have to pretend have recurring gynecological condition.
Might as well take rest of morning off anyway.
Wednesday 16 August
"Kept waking up bathed in sweat, panicking about the difference between the Ulster Unionists and SDLP and which of them Ian Paisley was involved in."
"before being picked up by the singsong personal assistant â€“ Patchouli â€“ who sported Lycra cycle shorts and a nose stud and blanched at my Jigsaw suit, as if, in a hideously misjudged attempt to be formal, I had turned up in a floor-length shot-silk Laura Ashley ball gown."
"she muttered, powering off down a corridor while I scurried after her."
"She burst through a pink door into a vast open_plan office strewn with piles of scripts, TV screens suspended from the ceiling, charts all over the walls, and mountain bikes propped against the desks."
At the far end was a large oblong table where the meeting was in progress.
Everyone turned and stared as we approached.
"A plump, middle_aged man with curly blond hair, a denim shirt and huge red spectacles was jigging up and down at the end of the table."
"he was saying, holding up his fists like a boxer."
How does a man with a girlfriend with looks like Elizabeth Hurley have a blow job from a prostitute on a public highway and get away with it?
What about the Shadow Cabinet?
What about the Peace Process?
He was obviously trying to work out how he could get away with sleeping with a prostitute himself.
"Suddenly, he was looking straight at me."
The entire table of grunge youths stared.
My mind went blank.
"There was a deathly hush, then Richard Finch started to laugh."
Then all the grunge youths started to laugh as well.
Tuesday 22 August
"9st 2, alcohol units 4, cigarettes 25, lottery tickets 5."
"Shazzer is going to the Edinburgh Festival, as is Tom, I think, also lots of people from the office."
Would like to go but not sure can afford it and fear presence of Daniel.
Also everyone will be more successful and having a better time than me.
Wednesday 23 August
Definitely going to Edinburgh.
Daniel is working in London so no danger of bumping into him on the Royal Mile.
It will be good for me to get away instead of obsessing and waiting for Good Afternoon!
Thursday 24 August
Friday 25 August
I am going to Edinburgh.
So generous and hospitable of her.
Saturday 26 August
I might finish The Famished Road.
I must go to see something tomorrow.
"She spent the entire train journey with the portable phone pressed to her ear, bellowing at the rest of us."
So shall we not go to Jenny Eclair â€“ Chuh!
"Secretly relieved, I walked or rather mountaineered back to the flat, picked up a lovely baked potato with a chicken curry and watched Casualty."
I was supposed to meet Perpetua at the Assembly Rooms at nine.
I went back to the George bar to look for Tina and find out where Shazzer was.
"It was my mother, done up like Marianne Faithfull and about to interview Alan Yentob."
she trilled in a Una Alconbury flower-arranging voice.
"Sunday 27 August, Edinburgh"
of shows seen 0.
I think she might have misunderstood something somewhere along the line.
There is a man in the house.
I can just tell.
Then it all went quiet and I heard Debby and the man whispering and him going into the kitchen.
2 p.m. Oh my God.
Met Jude in the George at three.
We were going to go to a Question and Answer session but we had a few Bloody Marys and remembered that Question and Answer sessions have a bad effect on us.
"You get hypertense trying to think up a question, putting your hand up and down."
"You finally get to ask it, in a semi-crouching position and odd high-pitched voice, then sit frozen with embarrassment, nodding like a dog in the back of a car whilst a twenty-minute answer in which you had no interest in the first place is directed at you."
"Anyway, before we knew where we were it was 5:30."
Then Perpetua appeared with a whole bunch of people from the office.
There was a big silence.
Monday 28 August
"Considerably less annoyingly, there was a letter from Richard Finch, the editor of Good Afternoon!"
"offering me a job, I think."
This is all it said:
"OK, my darling."
Tuesday 29 August
"9st2,, alcohol units 0 (v.g."
I had better go and tell him.
"Daniel stared at me, ashen-faced."
Then Perpetua burst in â€“ she must have been eavesdropping outside the door.
"Suddenly think I might love Perpetua, though not in a lesbian way."
Monday 4 September
"9st, alcohol units 0, cigarettes 27, calories 15, minutes spent having imaginary conversations with Daniel telling him what I think of him 145 (good, better)."
8 a.m. First day at new job.
"Must begin as mean to go on, with new calm, authoritative image."
"8:30 a.m. Mum just rang, I assumed to wish me luck for the new job."
"she said, pausing breathlessly and expectantly."
My mind went blank.
Brian â€“ and â€“ Elaine?
Begetters of the overperfect Mark Darcy.
"I hissed, suddenly suspicious."
"Had a clock on his desk, tick-tock-tick-tock."
Put something smart and bright on.
What about that lovely cerise two-piece you used to wear?
Felt so bad when she put the phone down that smoked five Silk Cut in row.
Non-vg start to day.
"In bed, completely exhausted."
I was late through no fault of my own.
It was impossible to get into the TV studios as I had no pass and the door was run by the sort of security guards who think their job is to prevent the staff from entering the building.
By this time it was 9:25 and the conference was at 9:30.
"Patchouli eventually appeared with two huge barking dogs, one of which started jumping up and licking my face while the other put its head straight up my skirt."
"and then disappeared, dragging the dogs."
"By the time I got in to the office, therefore, the meeting had started and everyone stared except Richard, whose portly form was clad in a strange green woolen boilersuit."
"he said, staring at me blakly."
A leery smile spread across his face.
There was a long pause.
"When the meeting was over I rushed to the loo to recover my composure where Patchouli was making herself up next to her friend, who was wearing a sprayed-on dress that showed her underpants and midriff."
the girl was saying to Patchouli.
"Both girls looked at me, horrified, with their hands over their mouths."
I am not sure if I am going to be able to stand this.
Saturday 9 September
8st 12 (v.g.
"advantage of new job with attendant nervous tension), alcohol units 4, cigarettes 10, calories 1876, minutes spent having imaginary conversations with Daniel 24 (excellent), minutes spent imagining rerun of conversations with mother in which I come out on top 94."
11:30 a.m. Why oh why did!
give my mother a key to my flat?
I was just-for the first time in five weeks-starting a weekend without wanting to stare at the wall and burst into tears.
I was weighing out 100 grams of cereal for my breakfast using a bar of chocolate (the weights for the scales are in ounces which is no good because the calorie chart is in grams).
"she said, beginning to open and shut all the cupboard doors."
"I said, standing in my socks and nightie trying to wipe the mascara from under my eyes."
Apparently he made a fortune in America .
"I said, to shut her up."
"she said, picking up the inexplicable sewing machine as she headed for the door."
I am not going to spend another evening being danced about in front of Mark Darcy like a spoonful of puried turnip in front of a baby.
I am going to have to leave the country or something.
8 p.m. Off to dinner party.
"All the Smug Marrieds keep inviting me on Saturday nights now I am alone again, seating me opposite an increasingly horrifying selection of single men."
"It is very kind of them and I appreciate it v. much but it only seems to highlight my emotional failure and isolation â€“ though Magda says I should remember that being single is better than having an adulterous, sexually incontinent husband."
"well, you know ."
"said Magda, rather too eagerly."
There was a stunned silence.
Where am I going to find a twenty-three-year-old who will come to dinner with Smug Marrieds on a Saturday night instead of taking contaminated Ecstasy tablets?
Friday 15 September
"9st, alcohol units 0, cigarettes 4 (v.g."
"he shouted, at which point the dogs under his desk woke up and started jumping about and barking."
yelled Patchouli above the din.
She was wearing a crocheted midi-dress with a floppy straw hat and an orange Bri-nylon saddle-stitched blouse on top.
As if the things I used to wear in my teens were a hilarious joke.
"OB crew outside Boots in the shopping center, live at five-thirty."
"Number of Dole Youths approached 44, Number of Dole Youths agreed to be interviewed 0."
Manchester-London train 7 p.m. Ugh.
"By 4:45 I was running hysterically between the concrete flower tubs, gabbling."
asked the cameraman with no attempt to feign interest.
then rushed round the corner and hit myself on the forehead.
where the fuck .
Then I spotted a cash machine on the wall.
"By 5:20 six youths claiming to be unemployed were neatly lined up in front of the camera, a crisp ?20 note in each of their pockets while I flapped around trying to make oblique amends for being middle-class."
"I began, to the expectant faces."
The youths clearly thought I had a syndrome that made me want to pretend I worked in TV.
"Worse, with working like a mad thing all week and coming up to Manchester I had been unable to do anything about the no-date trauma tomorrow."
"Then suddenly as I glanced across at the divine young whippersnappers, with the cash machine in the background, the genii of an extremely morally suspect idea began to form itself in my mind."
Would have been exploitative and wrong.
Think will go have a fag in the smoking carriage.
"Realize it is no longer possible for smokers to live in dignity, instead being forced to sulk in the slimy underbelly of existence."
Would not have been in least surprised if carriage had mysteriously been shunted off onto siding never to be seen again.
"Maybe privatized rail firms will start running Smoking Trains and villagers will shake their fists and throw stones at them as they pass, terrifying their children with tales of fire-breathing freaks within."
"Anyway, rang Tom from miracle-on-train-phone (How does it work?"
Maybe somehow connected through electric contact between wheels and tracks) to moan about the no-twentyâ€“ three-year-old date crisis.
Sometimes feel without Tom I would sink without trace and disappear.
Tuesday 19 September
8st 12 (v.g.
About to go on date with Diet Coke-esque young whippersnapper.
"Unfortunately, I was so overcome with gratitude* in the taxi on the way back I was powerless to resist his advances."
"** I did, however, manage to get a grip on myself *** and not accept his invitation to go in for coffee."
"Subsequently, however, I felt guilty about being a prick teaser,**** so when Gav rang and asked me round to his house for dinner tonight I accepted graciously."
** put my hand on his knee
*** my panic
***** could barely contain my excitement
Feel like Old Woman of the Hills.
"Unfortunately, however, when I got there, Number 4 Malden Road was a fruit and vegetable shop."
said the taxi driver wearily.
Turned our it was 44 Malden Villas and had not been concentrating when wrote it down.
Conversation between me and the taxi driver had rather dried up as we drove to the new address.
By the time I arrived I was feeling less than assured.
Gav had cooked spag bog.
The problem came when food preparation and serving were over and activities turned to conversation.
"We ended up, for some reason, talking about Princess Diana."
"Eventually we gave up on conversation and Gav, with tremendous excitement (this, I recall, the fabulous thing about twenty-two-year-olds) began to kiss me and simultaneously try to find entrances to my clothes."
Saturday 23 September
"9st,, alcohol units 0, cigarettes 0 (v.v.g."
There is no reason why I should go.
"I am not a close friend or relation, and would have to miss both Blind Date and Casualty."
Seem to remember from childhood am supposed to reply in same oblique style as if I am imaginary person employed by self to reply to invitations from imaginary people employed by friends to issue invitations.
Bridget Jones regrets that she will be unable .
"Miss Bridget Jones is distraught, that she will be unable ."
Devastated does not do justice to the feelings of Miss Bridget Jones .
It is with great regret that we must announce that so great was
kind invitation of Mr. Mark Darcy that she has topped herself
"and will therefore, more certainly than ever, now, be unable to"
The line went quiet at the other end.
There was a muffled sob.
I think Dad is having a nervous breakdown.
he broke down again.
Miss Bridget Jones has great pleasure .
Ms. Bridget Jones thanks Mr. Mark Darcy for his .
It is with great pleasure that Miss Bridget Jones accepts .
Thank you for your invitation to your ruby wedding party for Malcolm and Elaine.
I would love to come.
Will just copy it out neatly and check spellings then send it.
Tuesday 26 September
"8st 13, alcohol units 0, cigarettes 0, calories 1256, lottery tickets 0, obsessive thoughts about Daniel 0, negative thoughts 0."
Am perfect saint-style person.
It is great when you start thinking about your career instead of worrying about trivial things â€“ men and relationships.
I think I might have a gift for popular television.
The-really exciting news is that I am going to be given a tryout in front of the camera.
Richard Finch got this idea into his head at the end of last week that he wanted to do a Live Action Special with reporters attached to emergency services all over the capital.
"In fact people were going round the office saying he had been turned down by every Accident and Emergency unit, Police and Ambulance force in the Home Counties."
I want you on-camera.
Cannot wait to tell Mum.
Wednesday 27 September
"8st 11 (shrunk with embarrassment), alcohol units 3, cigarettes 0 (no smoking in fire station) then 12 in 1 hour, calories 1584 (v.g.)."
9 p.m. Have never been so humiliated in my life.
Spent all day rehearsing and getting everything organized.
The idea was that when they Cut to Lewisham I was going to slide down the pole into shot and start interviewing a fireman.
so I let go of the pole and started to slide.
"Bridget, stand by in Lewisham."
I thought about dropping to the bottom of the pole and rushing back up the stairs but I was only a few feet down so I started to pull myself up again instead.
Then suddenly there was a great bellow in my ear.
What the fuck are you doing?
"Hysterically I grinned at the camera and dropped myself down, landing, as scheduled, by the feet of the fireman I was supposed to interview."
Thursday 28 September
"8st 12,, alcohol units 2 (v.g."
11 a.m. Am in disgrace and am laughingstock.
"Funny thing is, though, the grunge youths are being much more friendly to me."
"Richard Finch now just either ignores me or shakes his head disbelieving whenever he comes anywhere near me, and I have been given nothing to do all day."
Date with Darcy
Sunday 1 October
"8st 11, cigarettes 17, alcohol units 0 (u.g., esp for party)."
One of the most startling evenings of life.
"After got depressed on Friday Jude came round and talked to me about being more positive about things, bringing with her fantastic black dress for me to borrow for party."
Was worried that might split or spill on the dress but she said she had lots of money and dresses because of top job and did not matter so not to worry about it.
Girls are so much nicer than men (apart from Tom-but homosexual).
Decided to accessorize fantastic dress with black tights with Lycra and Light Shimmer (?6.95) and Pied a terre kitten-heel black suede shoes (have got mashed potato off).
He had certainly gone to town for his mum and dad.
All the trees were dotted with red fairy lights and strings of shiny red hearts in a really quite endearing manner and there was a red and white canopied walkway leading all the way up the front path.
"At the door things began to look even more promising as we were greeted by serving staff who gave us champagne and relieved us of our gifts (I had bought Malcolm and Elaine a copy of Perry Como love songs from the year they were married, plus a Body Shop Terracotta Essential Oil Burner as an extra present for Elaine as she had been asking me about Essential Oils at the Turkey Curry Buffet)."
Next we were ushered down a dramatic curved pale wood stairway lit by red heart-shaped candles on each step.
"Downstairs was one vast room, with a dark wood floor and a conservatory giving onto the garden."
The whole room was lit by candles.
"Dad and I just stood and stared, completely speechless."
"Instead of the cocktail fancies you would expect at a parent-generational do -compartmentalized cut-glass dishes full of gherkins; plates sporting savory doilies and half grapefruits bespined with cheese-and-pineapple-chunk-ladened.toothpicks â€“ there were large silver trays containing prawn wontons, tomato and mozzarella tartlets and chicken sate."
Una Alconbury looked as though she had just eaten a lemon.
"said Una the second she was within earshot, pulling her stole huffily around her shoulders."
"After psyching myself up for so long for Jaeger two-piece hell, I was euphoric."
Mum too was now bearing down on us.
"I suddenly realized, cringing, that both Una and Mum must be coming up to their ruby weddings soon."
"Knowing Mum, it is highly unlikely she will let a trifling detail like leaving her husband and going off with a tour operator stand in the way of the celebrations and will be determined not to be outdone by Elaine Darcy at whatever price, even the sacrifice of a harmless daughter to an arranged marriage."
"hissed Una tensely, nodding at the room."
I glanced around nervously and jumped in fright.
"There, looking at us, not three feet away, was Mark Darcy."
He must have heard everything.
"He looked round, completely ignored me and looked back again."
He stared at me for a moment.
"Must see to the, er, placement."
"As he reached the top of the stairs, Natasha appeared in a stunning gold satin sheath, grabbing his arm possessively and, in her haste, tripping over one of the candles which spilled red wax on the bottom of her dress."
As they disappeared ahead I could hear her telling him off.
Your time would have been far better spent ensuring that the placement was .
"Funnily enough, the placement turned out to be rather brilliant."
"Mum was sitting next to neither Dad nor Julio but Brian Enderby, whom she always likes to flirt with."
My dad was pink with pleasure at sitting next to a stunning Faye Dunaway look-alike.
I was really excited.
But as I looked for my name on the chart a familiar voice piped up beside me.
Mark had thoughtfully put me between Geoffrey Alconbury and the gay vicar.
"Actually, though, once we all got a few drinks down us conversation was by no means stilted."
I was asking the vicar what he thought about the miracle of Indian statues of Ganesh the Elephant God taking in milk.
The vicar said the word in ecclesiastical circles was that the miracle was due to the effect on terracotta of a hot summer followed by cold weather.
"As the meal broke up and people started to make their way downstairs for the dancing, I was thinking about what he said."
"It took me a while to locate the terracotta oil burner, as it had been shoved near the back, but when I did I simply poured a little milk onto the teaspoon, tilted it and held it against the edge of the hole where you put the candle in."
The Essential Oil Burner was taking in milk.
You could actually see the milk disappearing from the teaspoon..
How was I to know that was when Mark Darcy would be bloody well walking past?
"he said, standing in the doorway."
He obviously thought I was trying to steal the presents.
"I put some more milk on the teaspoon, tilted the spoon and sure enough the oil burner slowly started to take it in."
"He was pretty impressed, I can tell you."
Just then Natasha appeared in the doorway.
Nice to see you again.
I decided I needed to go outside for a little fresh air and a fag.
"It was a wonderful, warm, starry night with the moon lighting up all the rhododendron bushes."
"Personally, I have never been keen on rhododendrons."
They remind me of Victorian country houses up north from D. H. Lawrence where people drown in lakes.
I stepped down into the sunken garden.
They were playing Viennese waltzes in a rather smart fin de millennium sort of way.
Then suddenly I heard a noise above.
A figure was silhouetted against the French windows.
"It was a blond adolescent, an attractive public schoolboy-type."
"He lit a cigarette unsteadily and stared, heading down the stairs towards me."
Really nice to meet you.
"he said, reverting to the public schoolboy again."
"I was flattered, to tell you the truth."
What with this and performing a miracle in front of Mark Darcy it was all starting to go to my head.
"he went on, seeing my face."
It was Mark Darcy.
Simon looked completely crushed.
He blushed scarlet and hurried back into the party.
"said Mark, holding out his hand to me."
"Then, noticing his baffled expression, I gabbled on."
Thank you very much.
"The truth is, he looked rather agitated and hurt."
"He paused, then started pacing around the patio, sighing and running his hand through his hair."
Ring the changes a bit.
"I said, childishly, hoping he would say something about sex."
"he said abruptly, and rather crossly, as if he was going to sit me down at a table somewhere and tell me off."
I stopped and stared at him.
Suddenly I realized what was going on.
"Anyway, what would we talk about?"
He stared at me in consternation.
"I said, rather pleased by the idea suddenly."
"It was Natasha, silhouetted against the lights, peering down to see what was going on."
Then when I met you .
and I was wearing that ridiculous diamond-patterned sweater that Una had bought me for Christmas .
"Bridget, all the other girls I know are so lacquered over."
"yelled Natasha, heading down the stairs toward us."
"and Mark Darcy and me forced to do tricks for the assembled company, like rubbing noses or having sex in front of them, like a pair of performing seals."
Tuesday 3 October
"8st 12, alcohol units 3 (v.g."
Mark Darcy is coming over to pick me up in half an hour.
Just got home from work with mad hair and unfortunate laundry crisis outfit on.
Was planning to wear white 501s but suddenly occurs to me he may be the type who will take me to a posh scary restaurant.
"Oh God, do not have anything posh to wear."
Do you think he will expect me to put bunny tail on?
7:50 p.m. Oh God oh God.
Still have not washed hair.
Will quickly get into bath.
8:00 p.m. Drying hair now.
V. much hope Mark Darcy is late as do not want him to find me in dressing gown with wet hair.
Hair is more or less dry now.
"Then just have to do makeup, get dressed and put mess behind sofa."
"Consider makeup most important, then mess disposal."
"Keen on a man who comes round lace, in stark contrast to people who come round early, startling and panicking one and finding unsightly items still unhidden in the home."
"8:20 p.m. Well, pretty much ready now."
Maybe will put something different on.
Does not seem like him to be more than half an hour late.
8:30 p.m. 9:00 p.m.
Cannot quite believe it.
Mark Darcy has stood me up.
Thursday 5 October
In loo at work.
"On top of humiliating standing-up debacle, found self horrible center of attention at morning meeting today."
The Isabella Rossellini trial.
Get yourself down to the High Court.
I want a hardheaded interview.
"What are you waiting for, Bridget?"
"I had no idea, not even a glimmer of a clue as to what he was talking about."
And now I must set off to meet scary camera crew at the law courts in five minutes to cover and report on a story on the television without having the faintest idea what it is about.
Thank God for Patchouli.
she stared at me for a moment.
"Oh, thank God and all his angels in heaven above."
I grabbed a couple of newspapers to bone up and ran for a taxi.
Cannot believe what just happened.
Was hanging around outside the High Court for ages with the camera crew and a whole gang of reporters all waiting for the trial to end.
"Was bloody good fun, actually."
Even started to see the funny side of being stood up by Mr.
Perfect Pants Mark Darcy.
I was just standing in the shop trying to keep all the change separate with the shopkeeper when this bloke walked in obviously in a real hurry and said.
The poor shopkeeper looked at me as if not sure what to do.
"I said in a hoity-toity voice, turning around to look at him."
I made a weird noise.
It was Mark Darcy all dressed up in his barrister outfit.
"He just stared at me, in that way he has."
At that moment the camera assistant burst into the shop.
"Speechless, I grabbed the edge of the sweet counter for support."
I said as soon as I could steady my breathing.
"I said, looking up at him desperately."
Just then our camera car drew up.
yelled the cameraman out of the window.
Cannot believe how marvelously everything has turned out.
Have just played the Good Afternoon!
headlines back for the fifth time.
Our home news correspondent.
Friday 6 October
"Left a message for Mum yesterday to tell her all about my scoop so when she rang tonight I assumed it would be to congratulate me, but no, she was just going on about the party."
Temptation to tell her what happened almost overwhelming but managed to control myself by envisaging consequences: screaming ecstasy at the making of the date and brutal murder of only daughter when she heard the actual outcome.
Keep hoping he might ring me up and ask me for another date after the hair dryer debacle.
Maybe I should write him a note to say thank you for the interview and sorry about the hair dryer.
Simple good manners demands it.
Thursday 12 October
"I hope otherwise), lottery tickets 3 (fair), 1471 calls to see if Mark Darcy has rung 12 (better)."
Incensed by patronizing article in the paper by Smug Married journalist.
When they leave work a gaping emotional hole opens up before them .
"How does Mrs. Smug Married-at-twenty-two think she knows, thank you very much?"
"Met Sharon, Jude and Tom after work."
looking at me coldly.
Friday 13 October
"9st 3 (but have temporarily turned into wine bag), alcohol units 0 (but feeding off wine bag), calories 0 (v.g.)."
*Actually might as well be honest here.
as only 0 because puked up 5876 calories immediately after eating.
An entire weekend stretching ahead with no one to love or have fun with.
Sunday 15 October
"9st (better), alcohol units 5 (but special occasion), agarettes 16, calories 2456, minutes spent thinking about Mr. Darcy 245."
8:55 a.m. Just nipped out for fags prior to getting changed ready for BBC Pride and Prejudice.
Hard to believe there are so many cars out on the roads.
Love the nation being so addicted.
"The basis of my own addiction, I know, is my simple human need for Darcy to get off with Elizabeth."
"The testosterone-crazed fans do not wish themselves on the pitch, claims Hornby, instead seeing their team as their chosen representatives, rather like parliament."
That is precisely my feeling about Darcy and Elizabeth.
"They are my chosen representatives in the field of shagging, or, rather, courtship."
"I do not, however, wish to see any actual goals."
"I would hate to see Darcy and Elizabeth in bed, smoking a cigarette afterwards."
That would be unnatural and wrong and I would quickly lose interest.
"Then we had a long discussion about the comparative merits of Mr. Darcy and Mark Darcy, both agreeing that Mr. Darcy was more attractive because he was ruder but that being imaginary was a disadvantage that could not be overlooked."
Monday 23 October
9st 2 alcohol units 0 (v.g.
"Have discovered delicious new alcohol substitute drink called Smoothies-v. nice, fruity), cigarettes 0 (Smoothies removes need for cigarettes), Smoothies 22, calories 4265 (4135 of them Smoothies)."
"When I stumbled upon a photograph in the Standard of Darcy and Elizabeth, hideous, dressed as modem-day luvvies, draped all over each other in a meadow: she with blond Sloane hair, and linen trouser suit, he in striped polo neck and leather jacket with a rather unconvincing moustache."
Apparently they are already sleeping together.
That is absolutely disgusting.
"Feel disorientated and worried, for surely Mr. Darcy would never do anything so vain and frivolous as to be an actor and yet Mr. Darcy is an actor."
Tuesday 24 October
"9st 3 (bloody Smoothies), alcohol Units 0, cigarettes 0, Smoothies 32."
On marvelous roll with work.
"Ever since Elena whatserface interview, seems can do no wrong."
"Richard Finch was saying, when I got into the office (bit late, actually, sort of thing that could happen to anyone), holding up his fists like a boxer."
"Suddenly, he was looking straight at me."
Everyone stared at me.
I took a deep breath.
He looked me up and down slowly.
The actors who play Darcy and Elizabeth?
"I always hoped I would turn out to be a genius, but I never believed it would actually happen to me â€“ or my left breast."
A Criminal in the Family
Wednesday 1 November
8st 13lb 8oz (yesss!
"Found Tom, however, in a complete lather about the forthcoming Alternative Miss World contest."
He was wearing a polystyrene sphere painted like map of the globe but with the polar ice caps melting and a large burn mark on Brazil.
"In one hand he was holding a piece of tropical hardwood and a Lynx aerosol, and in the other an indeterminate furry item which he claimed was a dead ocelot."
"I asked, fiddling with a bit of polystyrene."
"Anyone can enter: women, animals, anything."
"Eventually we agreed that though the global warming theme in itself was faultless, the polystyrene sphere was not, perhaps, the most flattering shape for evening wear."
"In fact in the end we found we were thinking more toward a fluid sheath of shot-silk-effect Yves Klein blue, floating over smoke and earth shades to symbolize the melting of the polar ice caps."
"All you have to do, apparently, is clean out all the cupboards in your flat to unblock yourself, then divide the flat up into nine sections (which is called mapping the ba-gua), each of which represents a different area of your life: career, family, relationships, wealth, or offspring, for example."
Whatever you have in that area of your house will govern how that area of your life performs.
"For example, if you keep finding you have no money it could be due to the presence of a wastepaper basket in your Wealth Comer."
V. excited by new theory as could explain a lot.
Resolve to buy Cosmo at earliest opportunity.
"Jude says not to tell Sharon as, naturally, she thinks Feng Shui is bollocks."
"Managed, eventually, to bring conversation round to Mark Darcy."
She said the answer was obvious: I should have a dinner party and invite him.
Friday 3 November
"9st2 (humph), alcohol units 2, cigarettes 8, Smoothies 13, calories 5245."
11 a.m. V. excited about dinner party.
Have bought marvelous new recipe book by Marco Pierre White.
At last understand the simple difference between home cooking and restaurant food.
"As Marco says, it is all to do with concentration of taste."
"The secret of sauces, of course, apart from taste concentration, lies in real stock."
"One must boil up large pans of fish bones, chicken carcasses, etc., then freeze them in form of ice-stockcubes."
Cannot believe have not realized this before.
This will be the menu:
Veloute of Celery (v. simple and cheap when have made stock).
Char-grilled Tuna on Veloute of Cherry Tomatoes Coulis with Confit of Garlic and Fondant Potatoes.
Grand Marnier Creme Anglaise.
Will become known as brilliant but apparently effortless cook.
Mark Darcy will be v. impressed and will realize I am not common or incompetent.
Sunday 5 November
"9st (disaster), cigarettes 32, alcohol units 6 (shop has run out of Smoothiesâ€“careless bastards), calories 2266, lottery tickets 4."
Bonfire night and not invited to any bonfires.
Rockets going off tauntingly left right and center.
"said Tom, staring at himself furiously in the mirror."
"It turned Out there was a very, very tiny bump where someone had shoved a glass in his face when he was seventeen."
I looked at him nonplussed.
I realized that I have spent so many years being on a diet that the idea that you might actually need calories to survive has been completely wiped out of my consciousâ€“ ness.
Have reached point where believe nutritional ideal is to eat nothing at all and that the only reason people eat is because they are so greedy they cannot stop themselves from breaking out and ruining their diets.
I thought about it.
"Tom says I am sick but I happen to know for a fact that I am normal and no different from everyone else, i.e., Sharon and Jude."
"Frankly, I am quite worried about Tom."
"I think taking part in a beauty contest has started to make him crack under the pressures we women have long been subjected to and he is becoming insecure, appearance obsessed and borderline anorexic."
Evening climaxed with Tom cheering himself up letting off rockets from the roof terrace into the garden of the people below who Tom says are homophobic.
Thursday 9 November
"8st 13 (better without Smoothies), alcohol units 5 (better than having huge stomach full of pureed fruit), cigarettes 12, calories 1456 (excellent)."
V. excited about the dinner party.
Fixed for a week on Tuesday.
This is the guest list:
Jude Vile Richard
Tom Pretentious Jerome
(unless get v. lucky and it is off
between him and Tom by Tuesday)
Me Mark Darcy
Mark Darcy seemed very pleased when I rang him up.
Daniel would never have said anything nice like that.
V. much looking forward to the dinner party.
Saturday 11 November
"8st 12, alcohol units 4, cigarettes 35 (crisis), calories 456 (off food)."
Then Sharon rang again.
"Starting to feel really panicky, at the same time enjoying sense of being at center of drama."
Must make more phone calls to test new theory.
"3:30 p.m. General opinion quashes new theory, since it is widely agreed to be impossible for Tom to meet new man, let alone start affair, without ringing everyone up to show off."
Cannot argue with that.
Wild thoughts ranging through head.
No denying that Tom has been disturbed lately.
Start to wonder whether am really good friend.
We are all so selfish and busy in London.
Would it be possible for one of my friends to be so unhappy that they .
"Aaargh, have suddenly remembered MP who died in a plastic bag with tubes around neck and chocolate orange in mouth or something."
Wonder if Tom has been doing weird sexual practices without telling us?
5 p.m. Just called Jude again.
You can see their point.
After spoke to Jude could not face shopping or similar lighthearted things.
Thought this might be the perfect time to do the Feng Shui so went out and bought Cosmopolitan.
"Carefully, using the drawing in Cosmo, I mapped the ba-gua of the flat."
Had a flash of horrified realization.
There was a wastepaper basket in my Helpful Friends Corner.
No wonder bloody Tom had disappeared.
Quickly rang Jude to report same.
Jude said to move the wastepaper basket.
"she said, when she came back."
"In the end I decided to put the wastepaper basket in my Knowledge Corner and went out to the greengrocer to get some plants with round leaves to put in the Family and Helpful Friends Corners (spiky-leaved plants, particularly cacti, are counterproductive)."
Was just getting plant pot out of the cupboard under sink when heard a jangling sound.
I suddenly hit myself hard on the forehead.
For a moment I thought about going round there without Jude.
Suddenly it stopped being a game.
Maybe something terrible and tragic actually had happened.
None of us spoke or looked at each other as we walked up the front steps.
whispered Sharon as I lifted the key to the lock.
"She looked at us quickly, then pressed the buzzer."
We stood in silence.
I beamed beatifically at the others.
"There was a pause, then the buzzer went."
came his voice as we reached the top floor and he opened the door.
All three of us cried out.
"I cried, clumsily trying to embrace him and ending up kissing his ear."
Jude burst into tears and Shazzer kicked the wall.
"I said again, tears beginning to plop down my cheeks."
"He was supposed to have been looked after by Jerome, henceforth to be known as Creepy Jerome (it was going to be heartless Jerome but we all agreed that sounded too interesting)."
"Poor Tom was so depressed and traumatized and so weird from the anaesthetic that he just unplugged the phone, hid under the blankets and slept."
Apparently he had waited till dead of night to go out and forage for food under cover of darkness.
In spite of our high spirits that he was alive Tom was still very unhappy about Jerome.
"I told him to ring my answerphone, which held twenty-two frantic messages from his friends, all distraught because he had disappeared for twenty-four hours, which put paid to all our fears about dying alone and being eaten by an Alsatian."
"Anyway, we told him, how could one moody geek with a stupid name make him think nobody loves him?"
"Meanwhile, Simon, Michael, Rebecca, Magda, Jeremy and a boy claiming to be called Elsie had all rung to see how he was."
I knew the Feng Shui would work.
Now-its task completed â€“ I am going to quickly move the round-leaved plant to my Relationship Corner.
Wish there was a Cookery Corner too.
Only nine days to go.
Monday 20 November
8st 12 (v.g.
"7 p.m. Just returned from hideous middle-class Singleton guilt experience at supermarket, standing at checkout next to functional adults with children buying beans, fish fingers, alphabetti spaghetti, etc., when had the following in my trolley:"
20 heads of garlic
tin of goose fat
bottle of Grand Marnier
8 tuna steaks
4 pints of double cream
4 vanilla beans at ?1.39 each.
Have to start preparations tonight as working tomorrow.
"8 p.m. Ugh, do not feel like cooking."
Especially dealing with grotesque bag of chicken carcasses: completely disgusting.
10 p.m. Have got chicken carcasses in pan now.
"Trouble is, Marco says am supposed to tie flavor-enhancing leek and celery together with string but only string have got is blue."
"Oh well, expect it will be OK."
"11 p.m. God, stock took bloody ages to do but worth it as will end up with over 2 gallons, frozen in ice-cube form and only cost ?l.70."
"Mmm, confit of oranges will be delicious also."
Now all have got to do is finely slice thirty-six oranges and grate zest.
1 a.m. Too tired to stay awake now but stock is supposed to cook for another two hours and oranges need another hour in oven.
"Will leave the stock on v. low heat overnight, also oranges on lowest oven setting, so will become v. tender in manner of a stew."
Tuesday 21 November
"8st 11 (nerves eat fat), alcohol units 9 (v. bad indeed), cigarettes 37 (v.v."
"bad), calories 3479 (and all disgusting)."
9:30 a.m. Just opened pan.
Hoped-for 2-gallon stock taste-explosion has turned into burnt chicken carcasses coated in jelly.
"Orange confit looks fantastic, though, just like in picture only darker."
Must go to work.
"Am going to leave by four, then will think of answer to soup crisis."
5 p.m. Oh God.
Entire day has turned into nightmare.
Richard Finch gave me a real blowing-up at the morning meeting in front of everyone.
What about that kid who had his penis burnt off by firecrackers in his pockets back in the sixties?
Where is he now?
"Bridget, find me the Fireworks Kid with no Penis."
She sounded unusually high-pitched and hysterical.
Of course I told you.
You must learn to listen.
I blinked at the phone.
I was wondering .
The way she said it reminded me of the way winos ask for money for a cup of tea.
She went all huffy.
yelled Richard as I tried to sneak out.
"I was waiting for my money to come, freshly baked and piping hot, out of the cash machine, wondering how my mother was going to manage for two weeks in Portugal on two hundred pounds, when I spotted her scurrying towards me, wearing sunglasses, even though it was pissing with rain, and looking shiftily from side to side."
Thank you very much.
"Must dash, going to miss the plane."
"she said, grabbing the banknotes from my hand."
What are you up to?
"For a second she looked frightened, as if she was going to cry, then, her eyes fixed on the middle distance, she adopted her wounded Princess Diana look."
She gave her special brave smile.
7 p.m. Just got home.
Soup will be absolutely fine.
Will simply cook and puree vegetables as instructed and then-to give concentration of flavor-rinse blue jelly off chicken carcases and boil them up with cream in the soup.
8:30 p.m. All going marvelously.
Guests are all in living room.
Mark Darcy is being v. nice and brought champagne and a box of Belgian chocolates.
Have not done main course yet apart from fondant potatoes but sure will be v. quick.
"Anyway, soup is first."
8:35 p.m. Oh my God.
Just took lid off casserole to remove carcasses.
Soup is bright blue.
9 p.m. Love the lovely friends.
"Were more than sporting about the blue soup, Mark Darcy and Tom even making lengthy argument for less color prejudice in the world of food."
"Why, after all, as Mark said â€“ just because one cannot readily think of a blue vegetable â€“ should one object to blue soup?"
"Fish fingers, after all, are not naturally orange."
"At which point Mark Darcy asked him what he did for a living, which was v. amusing because Vile Richard was sacked last week for fiddling his expenses.)"
Main course will be v. tasty.
"Right, will start on veloute of cherry tomatoes."
9:15 p.m. Oh dear.
"Think there must have been something in the blender, e.g."
"washing-up liquid, as cherry tomato puree seems to be foaming and three times original volume."
Also fondant potatoes were meant to be ready ten minutes ago and are hard as rock.
Maybe should put in microwave.
Just looked in fudge and tuna is not there.
What has become of tuna?
"Jude and Mark Darcy came in kitchen and helped me make big omelette and mashed up half-done fondant potatoes and fried them in the frying pan in manner of hash browns, and put the recipe book on the table so we could all look at the pictures of what chargrilled tuna would have been like."
At least orange confit will be good.
Tom said not to bother with Grand Marnier Creme Anglaise but merely drink Grand Marnier.
10 p.m. V. sad.
Looked expectantly round table as everyone took first mouthful of confit.
There was an embarrassed silence.
"Horror-struck, took mouthful myself."
"It was, as he said, marmalade."
Realize after all effort and expense have served my guests:
Am disastrous failure.
Did not think things could get any worse after the marmalade.
But no sooner was the horrible meal cleared away than the phone went.
Fortunately I took it in the bedroom.
over and over again in manner of a parrot.
I managed to get out eventually.
I saw the future unfolding before me like a horrible nightmare: Richard Finch dubbing me Good Afternoon!
"I also was unwise enough to leave the house in her name, and she has remortgaged it."
After that he broke down.
"Una came to the phone, saying that she was going to give Dad some Ovaltine."
"Replacing the receiver, I slumped against the wall cursing myself feebly for leaving my cigarettes in the living room."
"Immediately though, Jude appeared with a glass of Grand Marnier."
"I told her the whole story, pouring the Grand Marnier straight down my throat as I did."
He shook his head.
He started to pace around the room firing questions like a top barrister.
"It was pretty damn sexy, I can tell you."
Jude appeared with coffee.
"Mark decided the best thing would be if he got his driver to take him and me up to Grafton Underwood and, for a fleeting second, I experienced the totally novel sensation of being grateful to my mother."
"Found myself feeling guilty, since part of self â€“ despite horror â€“ was hugely enjoying the fact of normal business being suspended, everything different from usual and everyone allowed to throw entire glasses of sherry and salmon-paste sandwiches down their throats in manner of Christmas."
Wednesday 22 November
8st 10 (hurrah!
"10 a.m. Back in flat, completely exhausted after no sleep."
"On top of everything else, have to go to work and get told off for being late."
Dad seemed to be rallying a little when I left: alternating between moments of wild cheerfulness that Julio proved to be a bounder so Mum might come back and start a new life with him and deep depression that the new life in question will be one of prison-visiting using public transport.
Mark Darcy went back to London in small hours.
"I left a message on his answerphone saying thank you for helping and everything, but he has not rung me back."
Bet Natasha and similar would not feed him blue soup and turn out to be the daughter of criminal.
Una and Geoffrey said not to worry about Dad as Brian and Mavis are going to stay and help look after him.
It would be Bridget and Mark.
Bridget and Mark Darcy.
Not Mark and Bridget Darcy.
Friday 24 November
"8st 13, alcohol units 4 (but drunk in police presence so clearly OK), cigarettes 0, calories 1760, 1471 calls to see if Mark Darcy has rung 11."
10:30 p.m. Everything is going from bad to worse.
Have just been interviewed in my flat by police officers.
"Started behaving like people who are interviewed on the television after plane crashes in their front gardens, talking in formulaic phrases borrowed from news broadcasts, courtroom dramas or similar."
"Policemen were incredibly charming and reassuring, though."
"He was really friendly, actually."
Saturday 25 November
Dad has had a phone call from Mum.
"Apparently, she said not to worry, she was safe and everything was going to be all right, then hung up immediately."
So much wish Mark Darcy would ring.
"Was obviously completely put off by culinary disasters and criminal element in family, but too polite to show it at time."
"Am going to see Dad this afternoon, in manner of tragic spinster spurned by all men instead of in manner to which have been accustomed: in chauffeur-driven car with top barrister."
"Just as I was leaving had phone call, but could not hear anything but beeping sound at the other end."
Then the phone rang again.
"It was Mark, from Portugal."
Just incredibly kind and brilliant of him.
Apparently he has been talking to the police all week in between being top barrister and flew out to Albufeira yesterday.
The police over there have found Mum and Mark thinks she will get off because it will be pretty obvious she had no idea what Julio was up to.
"Mum is coming back tonight, but will have to go straight to a police station for questioning."
Then we got cut off before I even had time to say thank you.
Sunday 26 November
"9st 1, alcohol Units 0, cigarettes 1/2 (fat chance of any more), calories God knows, minutes spent wanting to kill mother 188 (conservative estimate)."
"Having first expected Mum back last night, then this morning, then this afternoon and having almost set off to Gatwick a total of three times, it turned out she was arriving this evening at Luton, under police escort."
"Dad and I were preparing ourselves to comfort a very different person from the one we had last been told off by, naively assuming that Mum would be chastened by what she had gone through"
"The two policemen rolled their eyes as Mum, dressed in a sixties-style black-and-white checked coat (presumably carefully planned to coordinate with the policemen), head scarf and dark glasses, zoomed back towards the baggage hall with the officers of the law wearily tagging after her."
Forty-five minutes later they were back.
One of the policemen was carrying the sun hat.
There was nearly a stand-up fight when they tried to get her into the police car.
What have you got on your face?
"It was only when Dad came over and curtly told her the house was about to be repossessed, vegetable basket included, that she shut up and huffily allowed herself to be put in the back of the car next to the policeman."
Monday 27 November
"9st 1., alcohol units 0, cigarettes 50 (yesss!"
9 a.m. Just having last fag before going to work.
Dad and I were made to wait on a bench in the police Station for two hours last night.
Eventually we heard a voice approaching along the corridor.
Of course you can.
Have you got a pen?
Who shall I put it to?
"Oh, you naughty man."
said Mum rolling her eyes at the senior detective and bustling me out of the door ahead of her.
and castanets in the trunk of the Sierra and had started the engine.
It was just some silly problem with the planning permission.
"They can be very corrupt, you know, the Portuguese authorities."
"We had a super holiday, actually!"
"The weather was very mixed, but ."
The phone rang for Dad.
My heart leaped into my mouth as I tried to control my features.
with the filthy wop .
I think The Gables may be saved .
I waited for Una to make some remark about me but none was forthcoming.
"The minute I decide I like Mark Darcy, everyone immediately stops trying to fix me up with him."
"said Una, passing Dad a mug of tea decorated with apricot floral frieze."
"When finally got away from scene of mayhem, drove far too fast on way back to London, smoking fags all the way as act of mindless rebellion."
Monday 4 December
"9st 2 (hmm, must get weight off before Christmas gorging), alcohol units a modest 3, cigarettes a saintly 7, calories 3876 (oh dear), 1471 calls to see if Mark Darcy has called 6 (g.)."
"Just went to supermarket and found self unaccountably thinking of Christmas trees, firesides, carols, mince pies, etc."
Then I realized why.
The air vents by the entrance which usually pump out baking bread smells were pumping out baking mince pies smells instead.
Cannot believe cynicism of such behavior.
Reminded of favorite poem by Wendy Cope which goes:
At Christmas little children sing and merry bells jingle.
The cold winter air makes our hands and faces tingle.
"And happy families go to church and cheerily they mingle,"
Still no word from Mark Darcy.
Tuesday 5 December
"9st 2 (right, am really going to start dieting today), alcohol units 4 (start of festive season), cigarettes 10, calories 3245 (better), 1471 calls 6 (steady progress)."
"Cannot help but feel sad about the brutal trampling on the pink silk shoots of romance burgeoning between me and Mark Darcy by Marco Pierre White and my mother, but trying to be philosophical about it."
"Maybe Mark Darcy is too perfect, clean and finished off at the edges for me, with his capability, intelligence, lack of smoking, freedom from alcoholism, and his chauffeur-driven cars."
"Maybe it has been decreed that I should be with someone wilder, earthier and more of a flirt."
"Like Marco Pierre White, for example, or, just to pick a name totally at random, Daniel."
Must just get on with life and not feel sorry for self.
"Just called Shazzer, who said it has not been decreed that I must go out with Marco Pierre White and certainly not with Daniel."
The only thing a woman needs in this day and age is herself.
Am going to be eaten by Alsatian despite all efforts to the contrary.
Friday 8 December
"9st 5 (disaster), alcohol units 4 (g.), cigarettes 12 (excellent), Christmas presents purchased 0 (bad), cards sent 0, 1471 calls 7."
At last â€“ a chance to get into those awkward corners with the duster.
I had thought that Jude and I were equal friends of Rebecca so why should she invite Jude and not me?
So it is a party party.
Must not get upset about it.
This is just the sort of thing that is not important in life anymore.
People should be allowed to invite who they want to their parties without others pettily getting upset.
How many more parties are going on that everyone has been invited to except me?
"I bet everyone is at one now, laughing and sipping expensive champagne."
No one likes me.
"Christmas is going to be a total party-desert, apart from a three-party pile-up on December 20th, when I am booked into an editing session all evening."
Saturday 9 December
Christmas parties to look forward to 0.
7:45 a.m. Woken by Mum.
"How, after being totally disgraced and narrowly escaping several years in custody, can my mother just plop back into being exactly like she was before, flirting openly with policemen and torturing me."
I shuddered with humiliation.
There is nothing worse than having to admit to your mum that you are not very popular.
9 a.m. Brief moment of party oasis when an invitation arrived in the post but turned out to be party mirage: invitation to a sale of designer eyewear.
11:30 a.m. Called Tom in paranoid desperation to see if he wanted to go out tonight.
"Oh God, I hate it when Tom is happy, confident and getting on well with Jerome, much preferring it when he is miserable, insecure and neurotic."
Decided to go shopping and stop obsessing.
2 p.m. Bumped into Rebecca in Graham and Greene buying a scarf for ?169.
One minute they were stocking filler-type items which cost ?9.99 next minute they have to be fancy velvet and cost as much as a television.
Next year it will probably happen to socks or pants and we will feel left out if we are not wearing ?145 English Eccentrics knickers in textured black velvet.)
I am going to quietly read a book all weekend and listen to classical music.
Maybe will read The Famished Road.
Blind Date was v.g.
Just going for another bottle of wine.
Monday 11 December
Returned from work to icy answerphone message.
I know you work in TV now.
Frantically called Rebecca but no reply or answerphone.
"Decided to go round and leave a note and bumped into Dan on the stairs, the Australian guy from downstairs who I snogged in April."
I looked at him blankly.
"I shot back upstairs, grabbed back the doormat and there, nestling underneath like a Christmas miracle, was a little pile of cards, letters and invitations all addressed to me."
Thursday 14 December
"9st 3, alcohol units 2 (bad, as did not drink any."
"units yesterday-must make up extra tomorrow to avoid heart attack), cigarettes 14 (bad?"
"a sensible level of nicotine units is probably good for you as long as do not binge-smoke), calories 1500 (excellent), lottery tickets 4 (bad but would have been good of Richard Branson had won non-profit-making lottery bid), cards sent 0, presents purchased 0, 1471 calls 5 (excellent)."
And why did he ask me what I was wearing?
Must not get over-excited and allow party casbah and phone call from feller-me-lad to go to self=s head.
"Best ring Jude, I think."
Tuesday 19 December
9st 7 (but still nearly one week to lose 7 lbs.
"before Christmas), alcohol units 9 (poor), cigarettes 30, calories 4240, lottery tickets 1 (excellent), cards sent 0, cards received 11, but include 2 from paper boy, 1 from dustman, 1 from Peugeot garage and 1 from hotel spent night in for work four years ago."
"Am unpopular, or maybe everyone sending cards later this year."
"9 a.m. Oh God, feel awful: horrible sick acidic hangover and today is office disco lunch."
"Am going to burst with pressure of unperformed Christmas tasks, like revision for finals."
"This year I bought her a big bottle of Saffron Oil with Champagne and a distressed wire soapdish, and she went into a complete grump muttering obvious lies about not having done her Christmas shopping yet."
"Last year Sharon gave me bubble bath shaped like Santa, so last night I just gave her Body Shop Algae and Polyp Oil shower gel at which point she presented me with a handbag."
"Would that Christmas could just be, without presents."
"It is just so stupid, everyone exhausting themselves, miserably hemorrhaging money on pointless items nobody wants: no longer tokens of love but angst-ridden solutions to problems."
"Though must admit, pretty bloody pleased to have new handbag.)"
What is the point of entire nation rushing round for six weeks in a bad mood preparing for utterly pointless Taste-of-Others exam which entire nation then fails and gets stuck with hideous unwanted merchandise as fallout?
"If gifts and cards were completely eradicated, then Christmas as pagan-style twinkly festival to distract from lengthy winter gloom would be lovely."
"But if government, religious bodies, parents, tradition, etc., insist on Christmas Gift Tax to ruin everything why not make it that everyone must go out and spend ?500 on themselves then distribute the items among their relatives and friends to wrap up and give to them instead of this psychic-failure torment?"
9:45 a.m. Just had Mum on the phone.
But we always get presents from Santa in sacks at the bottom of our beds.
World seems bleak and gray.
"Oh God, better go to work â€“ but will not have anything to drink at disco-lunch, just be friendly and professional to Matt, stay till about 3:30 p.m., then leave and do my Christmas cards."
Course is OK â€“ everyone drunks office Christmas parties.
Is a good fun.
Must gust sleep â€“ doen maur about clothesoff.
Wed 20 December
5:30 a.m. Oh my God.
Thursday 21 December
"9st 3 (actually, in funny sort of way there is no reason why should not actually lose weight over Christmas since am so full that â€“ certainly any time after Christmas dinner it is perfectly acceptable to refuse all food on grounds of being too full."
In fact it is probably the one time of year when it is OK not to eat).
For ten days now have been living in state of permanent hangover and foraging sub-existence without proper meals or hot food.
Christmas is like war.
Going down to Oxford Street is hanging over me like going over the top.
Would that the Red Cross or Germans would come and find me.
Have not done Christmas shopping.
Have not sent Christmas cards.
Got to go to work.
"Right, am never, never going to drink again for the rest of life."
Aargh â€“ field telephone.
It was Mum but might as well have been Goebbels trying to rush me into invading Poland.
That first one .
"Frankly, I would rather set fire to my flat all on my own than sit in it with Becca."
Cannot believe my mother is not more grateful to Mark Darcy for sorting everything out for her.
"Instead of which he has become part of That Which Must Not Be Mentioned, i.e."
"the Great Time-Share Rip-Off, and she behaves as if he never existed."
Cannot help but think he must have coughed up a bit to get everyone their money back.
V. nice good person.
"Too good for me, evidently."
Must put sheets on bed.
Disgusting to sleep on uncomfortable button-studded mattress.
"Where are sheets, though?"
Wish had some food.
Friday 22 December
"Now it is nearly Christmas, find self feeling sentimental about Daniel."
Cannot believe have not had Christmas card from him (though come to think of it have not managed to send any cards yet myself).
Seems weird to have been so close during the year and now be completely out of touch.
Maybe Daniel is unexpectedly Orthodox Jew.
Maybe Mark Darcy will ring tomorrow to wish me Happy Christmas.
Saturday 23 December
"9st 4, alcohol units 12, cigarettes 38, calories 2976, friends and loved ones who care about self this festive tide 0."
So glad decided to be festive Home Alone Singleton like Princess Diana.
6:05 p.m. Wonder where everybody is?
I suppose they are all with their boyfriends or have gone home to their families.
"Anyway, chance to get things done ."
or they have families of own.
Tiny fluffy children in pajamas with pink cheeks looking at the Christmas tree excitedly.
Or maybe they are all at a big party except me.
Only an hour till Blind Date.
Even Jude has forgotten about me.
She has been ringing all week panicking about what to buy Vile Richard.
"Latest idea was whisky but combined with other small gift so as not to seem cheapskate or anonymous-possibly combined with tangerines and chocolate coins, depending on whether Jude decided Christmas Stocking conceit over-cute to point of nausea or terrifyingly smart in its Post-Modernity."
Emergency: Jude on phone in tears.
Vile Richard has gone back to Vile July.
Thank God stayed home.
"Am clearly Emissary of Baby Jesus here to help those persecuted at Christmas by Herod-Wannabees, e.g."
Jude will be here at 7:30.
Missed start of Blind Date as Tom rang and is coming round.
"Jerome, having taken him back, has chucked him again and gone back with former boyfriend who is member of chorus in Cats."
7:17 p.m. Simon is coming round.
His girlfriend has gone back to her husband.
Thank God stayed at home to receive chucked friends in manner of Queen of Hearts or Soup Kitchen.
I made tebble mishtake.
Stupid Suki made of plastic.
Breast point north at all times.
"I love you, Jonesh."
"Gorgeous, messy, sexy, exciting, hilarious Daniel."
None of them turned up.
It was just over-emotional Spirit-of-Christmas Past making everyone wobbly about ex-partners.
You know I always watch the match on Saturday nights?
Entire year has been failure.
"5 a.m. Oh, never bloody mind."
Maybe Christmas itself will not be awful.
Sunday 24 December
"9st 4., alcohol units I measly glass of sherry, cigarettes 2 but no fun as out of window, calories 1 million, probably, number of warm festive thoughts 0."
V. confused about what is and is not reality.
"Mum and Dad, who are separated and planning to divorce, are sleeping in the same bed."
"In sharp contrast, my brother and his girlfriend, who have been living together for four years, are sleeping in separate rooms."
"The reason for all this is unclear, except that it may be to avoid upsetting Granny who is a) insane and b) not here yet."
Maybe Dad is at this moment attempting to mount Mum.
Why did brain think such thought?
Monday 25 December
Staggered downstairs hoping hair did not smell of fags to find Mum and Una exchanging political views while putting crosses in the end of sprouts.
"quipped Geoffrey, giving me one of his special hugs, then going all pink and adjusting his slacks."
"said Granny, looking straight at me."
"Dear God, please help me."
I want go home.
I want my own life again.
"I said, smiling smarmily at Mum, rushed up to the bedroom, opened the window and lit up a Silk Cut."
Two minutes later the bathroom window opened and an auburn-coiffed head stuck out and lit up.
It was bloody Mum.
Gift exchange was nightmare.
"Always overcompensate for bad presents, yelping with delight, which means I get more and more horrid gifts each year."
"Thus Becca â€“ who, when I worked in publishing, gave me a worsening series of book-shaped clothes-brushes, shoehorns and hair ornaments â€“ this year gave me a clapperboard fridge magnet."
"Una, for whom no household task must remain ungadgeted, gave me a series of mini-spanners to fit different jar or bottle lids in the kitchen."
They circled each other like fighters.
This happens every year with the gravy.
Mercifully there was a distraction: a great crash and scream as a figure burst through the French windows.
"Everyone froze, and Una let out a scream."
He was unshaven and clutching a bottle of sherry.
He stumbled over to Dad and drew himself up to his full height.
"Can I get you a sherry â€“ ah, got one already."
"Now he was wild, drunk, unkempt and, frankly, just the type I fill for."
No wonder Mum seemed more aroused than embarrassed.
She was still in love with him.
I looked out of the window and nearly jumped out of my skin.
"There was Mark Darcy slipping, lithe as a whippersnapper, across the lawn and in through the French windows."
"He was sweating, dirty, his hair was unkempt, his shirt unbuttoned."
"We were all so stunned, and he so thrillingly authoritative, that we started doing as he said as if hypnotized zombies."
The police are outside.
Everyone held their breath.
There was no response.
"He did what I said, then gave me a thumbs-up."
I gave him a thumbs-up back and cleared my throat.
I shouted up the stairs again.
"Ten seconds later there was a pounding down the stairs and Mum burst in, looking flushed."
Even as she spoke there were footsteps running up the stairs and a scuffle broke out above us.
shrieked Mum and started to run for the door.
The detective I recognized from the police station was standing in the living room doorway.
"Mum let out a scream as Julio, handcuffed to a young policeman, appeared in the hallway and was bundled out of the front door behind the detective."
"I watched her as she collected herself and looked round the room, appraising the situation."
"I stared at the hideous scene, feeling as though my whole world was collapsing around my ears."
Then I felt a strong hand on my arm.
This is what happened next:
"Mark Darcy took me to Hintlesham Hall for champagne and late Christmas lunch, which was v.g."
Particularly enjoyed freedom to pour gravy onto Christmas turkey for first time in life without having to take sides about it.
Christmas without Mum and Una was a strange and wonderful thing.
"Was unexpectedly easy to talk to Mark Darcy, especially with Festive Julio Police Siege Scene to dissect."
"It turns out Mark has spent quite lot of time in Portugal over the last month, in manner of heartwarming private detective."
"Bloody Mum, I thought."
How come she gets to be the irresistible sex goddess?
Maybe I should go to Color Me Beautiful after all.
When we got upstairs it turned out he had taken a suite.
"It was fantastic, v. posh and bloody good fun and we played with all the guest features and had more champagne and he told me all this stuff about how he loved me: the sort of stuff, to be honest, Daniel was always coming out with."
You stood me up because you were drying your hair?
And the first time I met you I was wearing that stupid sweater and bumblebee socks from my aunt and behaved like a complete clod.
"and did all manner of things which mean whenever I see a diamond-patterned V-neck sweater in future, I am going to spontaneously combust with shame."
